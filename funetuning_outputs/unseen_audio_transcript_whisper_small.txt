 you you you you you you you you you you you you you Check. Thank you. you you you you you Before we begin, perhaps we can have some assessment from your side on the time schedule so that time schedule and order of submission so that we can we have some broad idea. So there's a bit of disorder at this side, but on that point, but we shall tell you a lot. So, roughly, Mr. Sibyl, how long would you, you'd be arguing first after you, who would be arguing Mr. Sibyl? Gopal Mullahs. Mr. Subramaniam is going to be arguing after that. Then Dr. Dhawan Malat. second, then we'll never, there'll be no end to it. So once the ground has been covered by the council who has argued first, then after that the second council, then for the others, I think. So, can we suggest that you can continue until lunch tomorrow because we're starting right up in the morning. We'll take mothers a little more than that because we have to go through the history because this has to be dealt with in a historical context. Mullahs, let me put it this way. I will try and do it. Mullahs, and if you are watching speed Mullahs, then I need a little more time to watch it. We feel that our conscience also has to be satisfied if we have heard that side of the history is important. Mr. Subramaniam and Mr. Shaker Nafeer have, I should say built for eight hours but at least it's like they are going to take eight hours. So, I think the eight hours and ten hours for Mr. Subramaniam, I think that's a little bit of an overstatement. I think we'll have to cut down that and Mr. Nafeerafri will also request you to cut down your submission. He is not addressing because the party for whom he is appearing has withdrawn. But the point is on the last hearing almost 90% was, we are first party to the hearing. In I think about 4 days or so, 4 to 5 days we had almost finished the hearing of the petition. Question of the reference on those two judgments. The difficulty was on the preliminary issues frame whether 19s. No, most parties I'm sorry, the most parties argued the merits of the matter. Some of the people, Mr. Ramachandra, Mrs. Abhashya, they argued the simple open and I'm sure by the end of the day, we'll have a good picture. I think little more than that. That Mr. That's right. I am really sorry to do this but clarification is needed whether it is got three. My Lord, Uncle Justice Borsig, Bench can hear mentioning this is something very urgent. There is a provision in the latest SOP. There is a provision in the SOP. Circulate an email. I have said that you know however urgent something is once the mentioning is not available the mentioning is over, just an email will be put up to me by the registrar listing. I'll pass orders immediately. So you follow, just read the SOP. It has everything in that. Because all your lordships and constitution passed. I think yesterday, every mentioning request which was made until late night yesterday was attended to. I was in fact a little more liberal because I knew that this is going to happen that we are the first five are going to be in a constitution bench. All requests have been granted. If there's something over and above that the SOP has a promotion even for that. Follow the SOP. I'll give you a saying. Yeah, I want to say. We are not calling this matter by the name of any individual litigant. We are saying in the article 370. I think that should resolve your problem. I agree. My request is only that of course I filed a first petition. I have a very serious issue with me. Permit me to argue in the last. I'm not saying allow me whatever is going to be submitted by anyone over here. I have total different things. Yes, you will may it be so. of clarification, a lot of chip. I was appointed a nodal council. Unfortunately, I'm not able to present as I'm down with conjunctivitis, but the repetition civil 1099 2019 in which Mr. Ramchandran was appearing. Although two parties have withdrawn, there are other petitioners who are still prosecuting this case. And that will be representation for that as well. It's clear because we did not give interveners to you know what areas still remain? We will assign some time. Yes, Mr. Sikbal would be arguing which petition so that we can have that. It's in the 370 now. No, who you represent, so that we can say that. Mr. Lone.

It is also historic because it has taken five years for your Lordships mothers to start hearing this case. And for five years mothers, there has been no representative government in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is also historic because you will have to interpret article 356 of the Constitution of India. جموہ اور کشمی کے ساتھ جانتے ہیں۔ یہ جو ہیسٹوریک ہے لیکن آپ کو ارتکل 356 کیا اردنی کیا ہے۔ ایک ارتکل کیا ہے کہ اردنی کیا ہے؟ اور اردنی کیا ہے کہ اردنی کیا ہے؟ آپ کو اردنی کیا ہے؟ جو اردنی کیا ہیں کہ جموھ اور کسمیر کیا ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ بھی دیتے ہیں جو بہت ساتھ اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے پارٹی پر سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبوٹ سبو the imposition of article 356.

I will address your logics on those issues. These are issues that will arise for your logics. Consideration never raised, never decided by this court. So in that sense too, it is historic. Summala, I will proceed because there is a historical context to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. So I'll have to take your Lordship through that history. And if your Lordship will permit me, I'll start with a list of dates. As far as all comes and know that all the arguments, we have the benefit now of live transcription. to software like in the Maharashtra case by the end of the day the transcripts will be given to the arguing council your juniors can just verify that there are no mistakes if there are any corrections they can be given to the registry so that we will upload them immediately on our website so they are available for everybody then too that will also help council work following because it helps us as well as well as everybody else. So Malar that start off with a list of dates which is Malarad's volume two written submissions volume two PDF page 33. We were reluctant students with your logins in short that we become disciplined students. Yes, the list of dates because it's somewhat elaborated because it will give you a flavor what the issues are. The I'm It's called appendix one list of dates and events. That's correct. That's correct. It comes up. Okay. . Amalas, before this, may I, Amalas, state one, want to make one statement clear, Amalas, that we stand here on the premise that the integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India is unquestionable, was unquestionable, and always جمویں کشمیڈ کے بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے اور ایک انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں جانتا ہے جو انکویسٹنی بارے میں سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بہت سکتا ہے۔ ایک ساتھ بھی بھی بہت The third is the constitution of India as applicable in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Third is the constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. And fourth is article 370. The interaction between these three constitutions in the context of article 370 is something that your Lord Jesus will have to look at as we move forward. But please keep that in mind. The reason why I say constitution of India is applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir that over time there were several orders issued, constitutional orders from time to time, which were incorporated in the constitution of Constitution of India applicable to the country. The result was that most of the powers that are that most of the responsibilities and powers were actually in tandem with the Constitution of India. There was in fact really no difference other than Article 370 itself. All the laws were applicable. Except that those laws were replicated and جو اپنے بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں کسی بارے میں It's in that context that I'm mentioning this. On the 9th of March, 1846, the Treaty of Lahore was executed between Maharaja and the British government, resulting in the transfer of certain territories to the East India Company, in particular under Article 4 of the Treaty. The Maharaja's seeds to the honorable company, all his forts, territories, rights and interests in the hill countries, which are situated between the river Beas and Indus, including provinces of Kashmir and Hazara. Earlier Jammu's Maharaja Gulab Singh's General Zorabhar Singh had invaded Ladakh in 1834. Ladakh came under Dogra rule and was incorporated into the state of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846. During the Sino-Seekh war, the Queen Empire invaded Ladakh, but the Sino-Tibetan army was defeated. Ladakh was claimed as a part of Tibet by Funtz-Tok Wangyal, a Tibetan communist leader. In 1947, partition left Ladakh a part of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir to be administered from Srinagar. On the 16th of March 1846, following the Treaty of Lahore, the British government executed the Treaty of Amritsar on March 16, 1846. Under the treaty, the Hilly mountainous country with its dependence is situated in the east of river Indus and west of river Ravi-Ghavi, including Chamba and Exclusion ایک مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، مجھے بیٹی، م There was a violation of the Treaty of Lahore and therefore compensation had to be paid for us to the British government He was not able to pay that compensation in lieu of that compensation. These territories were seated That's what on the 30th of June 1857 Gulab Singh died and was succeeded by a son run piercing Following the passage of the Government of India Act 1858, territories formally in possession under control of the East India Company were vested in the British monarch in whose name India was to be governed. 1885, Maharaja Ranbir Singh died and was succeeded by Maharaja Pratap Singh. In 1889, 30th of August, the Interpretation Act of 1889 was passed by the UK Parliament. Section 184 of the Act defined the expression Prishidh India. All territories and places within her Majesty's Dominion, which are for the time being governed by her Majesty through the Governor-General of India. In addition, the term India was defined under Section 185 as British India, together with any territories of any native prince or chief under the sovereignty of Her Majesty exercised to the Governor-General of India. You will note here, Mother Jammu and Kashmir is not part of this. In 1925, Maharaja Pratap Singh was succeeded by Maharaja Hari Singh, the last ruler of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. And on the 20th of April 1927, the expression state subject was defined in the state subject definition notification dated April 20, 1927, which was issued by Maharaja Hari Singh. This notification classified state subjects into four classes and subsequently became the basis for the definition of permanent residence of Jammu and Kashmir under the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir in article 35A of the Constitution of India. Your lotions need not go into it because we are not really dealing with that. But I'm just mentioning it. On the 22nd of April 1934, Maharaja Hari Singh enacted Regulation 1 of Sambharth 1991 on April 22, 1934. Wherever there is Sambharth Malat, if you take away 57 years, that gives you the year. The regulation established a legislative assembly for the state of Jammu and Kashmir called the Prajaprabha. While certain legislative functions were delegated to the Prajaprabha the ruler Maharaja Hari Singh retained supremacy over all legislative, executive and judicial matters. On the 2nd of August, 1935, the Government of India Act 1935 was passed by the UK Parliament. The Act established India as a federation comprising governors provinces, chief commissioners provinces, the Indian states which had or would exceed the federation of India. Under section six of the said act, the ruler of Indian princely states was empowered to execute an instrument of accession declaring that he exceeds to the Federation of India subject to the terms of such instrument. Under section two, an instrument of accession was to specify matters with respect to which the federal legislature would have the over such statement. Notably, as the state of Jammu and Kashmir was not a part of British India, provisions of the Government of India Act 1935 did not apply to it unless an instrument of accession was executed by its ruler in accordance with Section 6. On the 7th of September, 1939, the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution Act Act 1939 was promulgated. While Maharaja Hari Singh retained sovereignty and supremacy over all legislative, executive and judicial functions, the Act provided the Prajashabha to make laws for the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir or any part thereof, subject to certain conditions. Further, the SED Act vested executive functions with counsel consisting of a Prime Minister and other ministers appointed by the ruler. The Act also provided for the High Court, which had been established by the ruler in 1928, to be a court of record with jurisdiction to adjudicate upon inter-alias civil suits, civil criminal and revenue. On the 16th of May 1946, the Cabinet mission issued a statement regarding its report. Under paragraph 15.1 and 4 of that statement, the Cabinet mission plan envisaged a union of India where the union would have responsibility over defense, foreign affairs and communications and the states would retain jurisdiction over all other subjects not ceded to the union. On the 12th, 22nd of May 1946, the cabinet mission issued a memorandum titled States, Treaties and Parli Pabyan Paramansi, which affirmed that following the establishment of an independent government in India, the paramansi of the British monarch over Indian states would lapse and paramansi power over their respective territories would return to the states. On the 19th of December 1946, the constituent assembly of India, in terms of the Cabinet Mission Plan, met for the first session. On the 22nd of January 1947, the Constituent Assembly of India unanimously adopted the Objectives Resolution, which declared the Assembly's firm and solemn resolve to proclaim India as an independent sovereign republic. Importantly, it paragraph three of the Objectives Resolution اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے others as may be determined by the Constituent Assembly and thereafter, according to the law of the Constitution, shall possess and retain the status of autonomous units together with residuity powers and exercise all powers and functions of government and administration, save and accept such powers and functions as are vested in or assigned in the Union. On the 25th of January, 1947, the Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution for the establishment of the Union Powers Committee to inter-ailea draw up lists of matters included in the an interconnected with the subjects assigned to the union before the framing of the Constitution. On the 5th of July, 1947, the Union Powers Committee submitted its second report of the Constitu May statement. Some of them have expressed themselves as willing to cede wider powers to the center than contemplated in that statement. But we consider it necessary to point out that the application to states in general of the Federalist of subjects insofar as it goes beyond 16th May statement, should be with their consent. It follows from this that in their case, the judiciary powers would vest with them unless their consent to their vesting in the centre. And your Lordship knows whether that consent was given. The UK Parliament on 18th of July 1947 passed the Indian Independence Act of 1947 under section 11 of the Act from August 15, 1947, two independent Dominians, India and Pakistan, were to be established. Significantly, section 7-1B of the Act stated that following independence, the sovereignty of the British monarch over Indian states would lapse and return to the rulers of such states. Resultantly, sovereign states as many as 562 princely states had the choice to remain independent or exceed to either of the two dominions established by the act. Lastly, as a transitional measure, Section 8 prescribed that provisions of the Government of India Act 1935 would continue to apply the The India Provisional Constitutional Order 1947, which made certain sections of the Government of India Act 1935 applicable to India, until other provisions were made by the Constitutional Assembly. Among the applicable provisions was Section 6, which dealt with accession of princely states to India through the execution of the instrument of accession. On the 15th of August, India attained independence and was partitioned into the dominions of India and Pakistan. Further, as British paramansi had lapsed, princely states that had not executed instruments of accession with either dominion became independent states, these included the states of Duneagar, Hyderabad, and Jammu and Kashmir. On 26th of October 1947, the ruler of Jammu and Kashmir made an offer of accession to India, asking for help from the Indian Dominion to meet a grave emergency caused by mass infiltration of tribesmen drawn from distant area of northwest frontier, coming regularly in motor trucks, Mansehra, Muzafrabad road and fully armed with up-to-date weapons which cannot possibly be done without the knowing of the provincial government of the northwest frontier province and the government of Pakistan. In the instrument of accession signed by him on the same date, he declared his accession to India subject to the term of such instrument. Under section three of the instrument, the Dominion Legislature had authority to make laws for the state of Jammu and Kashmir on the subjects of defense, external affairs and communication, Article 7, provided that the instrument of accession did not commit the ruler to the acceptance of any future constitution of India while Section 8 vested sovereignty over subjects not exceeded to India in the ruler. But there's just two issues I want to flag here. Your Lordships in the course of this hearing will have to determine what does a constituent assembly stand for? A constituent assembly stands for enacting a constitution for the future of the territories with respect to which the constitution is to apply. It's essentially a political exercise. It's not a legal exercise. It's a political exercise to take into account the aspirations of people, what kind of state the people want, and in the context of that draft the constitution. Right? The constitution itself is a political document, but it takes into account the aspirations of several segments of society living within a united territory. Takes into account their separate aspirations. And in the context of that drafts a constitution to meet the aspirations in future years for decades to come. So the exercise of a constituent assembly is a political exercise. The drafting of the constitution, which is a political document is a political expose. اپنے کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کسیٹوٹ کی حالتہ ہے جو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو کانتیوشن کو باریمین کن not convert itself into a constituent assembly Today, the Indian parliament can't say by a resolution that we are the constituent assembly. As a matter of law, they can't say it because they are now cabined, gripped and confined by the provisions of the constitution. They can't pass a law which is outside the list. They can pass a law under 254. If the state passes a law, it's repugnant. They must adhere to the basic features of the constitutions. They can't suspend except in emergencies where external aggression, the fundamental rights of people, that also is limited under provisions of the constitution. The executive can't build us new things which are contrary to the law. And the judiciary then declares the law. اپنے کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹر میں کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیٹی میں اپنے کامیمیر کے لیے جانتے ہیں کہ ہم جموے اور کشمیر کے لیے جانتے ہیں کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ جموے اور کشمیر کے لیے جانتے ہیں کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا ہے کہ ہمیشہ دیکھونا No, I'm just kidding. So that's Muller's according to me the core of the issue that your Lordships will have to decide. May I now, Malaz with your lurches permission, read the instrument of accession because what happened on the 26th of October, actually Malaz the invasion so to say was started on the 20th of October and Malaz within six days these decisions were taken because the invaders came, they were armed, they had guns, they would have run اور ملیدوں میں 6 دن کے لئے یہ درسیسوں کو بھی لگتا ہے لیکن امیدروں نے بھی امیدروں نے بھی جانتا تھا وہ بھی گنگوں نے سید میں بھی رہا تھا رولر نے امیدروں نے امیدروں نے امیدروں نے امیدروں نے پاکستان کے لئے بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی India refused to enter into a standstill agreement with him. And then thereafter what happened was that he said, look, I need help and he told man back and I cannot possibly secure the mic by my people. So thereafter, the proceedings started, he sought and he said, look, if you help me, I will unconditionally access to India subject to my own conditions, which is separate from the instruments of accession of other states. And India accepted it and that's how India secured the peace and was able to manage. And of course, the precursor to that is the Ratcliffe Award in terms of which the part of the Buddha's quote would connect the Tamil-Kashmir Malas to India was seeded to India under the Ratcliffe Award which allowed for that contiguity which was the basic principle of the basis of which the partition was to take place. So that's how all this happened. Now let me read your logic of the instrument of accession. Volume 1, Muller's. Documents volume 1. Muller's kindly come to PDF page. Yes, PDF page 7, offer of accession by Maharaja Hari Singh on 26th of October 1947. Documents volume one, PDF in one minutes. I didn't know. is in the actually. Please Mother's seven. Yes, offer of accession by Maratha. We can with grade seven. Yes, state seven. 26th October, 1947. Sir, you are offering documents volume one. Yes, volume one. Yes. So I have to inform my may I? I have to inform your Excellency that the grave emergency is a little in my state and request immediate assistance of your government. And the excellency is aware the state of Jammu and Kashmir has not exceeded to the division of Dominion of India or to Pakistan. Geographically, my state is contiguous to both the Philippines. It was vital. It has vital economic and cultural links with both of them. Besides, my state is a common boundary with the Soviet Republic of China. In their external relations, and Dominion of India and Pakistan cannot ignore this fact. I wanted to take time to decide to which Dominion I should exceed. Basically, he wanted to be independent quite frankly. But given this situation, he had no choice. Or whether it is not in the best interest of both the Dominions and my state to stand independent, of course, with friendly and cordial relations with both. I accordingly approached the Dominions of India and Pakistan and entered into a standstill agreement with my state. Pakistan government accepted this agreement. The dominion of India desired further discussions with the definitely Rumaan government. I could not arrange this in view of the developments indicated below. In fact, the Pakistan government are operating post-intelligrat system inside the state. and desperados with modern weapons have been allowed to infiltrate into the state at first in Poonch and then in Sialkot. There was a Poonch revolt, and finally in the mass area, a joining Hazara district from the Ramkot side. The result has been that the limited number of troops at the disposal of the state had to be dispersed and thus had to face the enemy at several points simultaneously. That it has become difficult to stop the wanton discussion of life and property and looting. The Mahara powerhouse which supplies the electric current to the whole of Srinagar has been burnt. The number of women who have been kidnapped and raped makes my heart bleed. The wild forces that let loose on the state are marching on with the aim of capturing Srinagar, the summer capital of my government, as first step to overrunning the whole state. The mass infiltration tribesmen drawn from the distant areas of northwest frontier, coming regularly in motor trucks using Mansehra, Muzhaprabha's road and fully armed with up-to-date weapons cannot possibly be done without the knowing of the provincial government of the NWFP and the government of Pakistan. In spite of repeated requests made by my government, no attempt has been made to check these vaders or stop them from coming to my state. The Pakistan radio even put out a story that a provincial government has been set up in Kashmir. the situation as it exists, I say, I have no option, I have no option but to ask for help from the Indian Dominion. Naturally, they cannot send the help asked for by me without my state exceeding with the Dominion of India. I have accordingly decided to do so and I attached the instrument of accession for acceptance by your government. The other alternative is to leave my state and my people as the feebooters. On this basis, no civilized government can exist or be maintained. The alternative I will never allow to happen as long as I am ruler of the state and I have life to defend my country. I may also inform your Excellencies government that it is my intention to once to set up an interim government and ask Sheikh Abdullah to carry the responsibilities in this emergency with my Prime Minister. If my State has to be saved, immediate assistance must be available at Srinagar. Mr. Menon is fully aware of the situation and he will explain to you if further explanation is needed in his and with kindness regards. Just a historical fact at that point in time, whether Sheikh Abdullah was in prison ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید اس کے حالت میں ملید a despotic ruler. So he was against the Sardar-e-Riasat so to say. But when he realized that, look, unless I get him on my side, I'm not going to be able to defend. So he released him and I take somebody's name, they'll be the other side. No, no, no. There's nothing to do with this. I don't want to enter into politics here. No politics. I don't want fireworks in a very solemn occasion like this. Thank you. you you . So, now the instrument of accession, page 9. Actually, the Lordship knows more than we do. The Lordship knows more about it than we do. We always keep learning. I just told them there were seven miles from the swinega. Yes, the swinega army was asked to do. Absolutely, absolutely. Electricity, Malasas. And they could not be controlled Malasas. They were there. So it was no choice. I mean he never wanted to succeed but they were no choice. So Malas, May I Malas, page nine. Whereas the Indian Independence Act 1947 provides that as it's obvious Malas 15th August was independence. He did not immediately exceed all the others. Maharajas exceeded apart from those two. He never wanted to. It's only in October that this happened. Whereas the Indian Independence Act 1947 provides that as from the 15th day of August 1947, they shall be set up an independent dominion known as India. And that the Government of India Act 1935 shall, with such omissions, additions, adaptations and modifications as the Governor General may by order specify, be applicable to the Dominion of India. And whereas the Government of India Act 1935 as so adopted by the Governor General provides that I declare that I exceed to the Dominion of India with the intent of the Governor General of India, the Dominion Legislature, the Federal Court and any other Dominion authority established for the purposes of the Dominion shall by virtue of this instrument, this my instrument of accession. But subject always to the terms thereof, I need to mark that. Subject always to the term thereof and for the purposes only of the Dominion exercise in relation to the state of Jammu and Kashmir such functions as may be vested in them by or under the government of India 1935 as enforced in the Dominion of India on the 15th day of August 1947 such function there may be vested. I hereby assume the obligation of ensuring that due effect is given to the provisions of the Act within the state so far as they are applicable therein by virtue of my instrument of accession. I accept the matter specified in the schedule here too as the matters with respect to which the Dominion Legislature may make law for this state. I hereby declare that I accede to the Dominion of India on the assurance that if an agreement is made between the Governor, the ruler of this state, whereby any functions in relation to the administration of this state of any law of the Dominion Legislature shall be exercised by the ruler of the state, that any such agreement shall be construed and have effect accordingly. In terms of this instrument of accession, my instrument of accession shall not be buried by any amendment of the Act or the Indian Independence Act 1947 unless such amendment is accepted by me by instruments supplementary to this instance. Nothing in this instrument shall empower the Dominion Legislature to make any law for this state authorizing the compulsory acquisition of land for any purpose. But I hereby undertake that should the Dominion for the purpose of a Dominion law which applies in the state deem it necessary to acquire any land, I will at their request acquire the land at their expense. For if the land belongs to me, transfer it to them on such terms that may be agreed or in default of agreement determined by an arbitrator to be appointed by the Chief Justice of India. Nothing in this instrument shall be deemed to commit in any way to my acceptance of any future constitution of India or to fatter my discretion to enter into an agreement with the government of India under any such future constitution. Nothing is an instrument that affects the continuance of my sovereignty in and over the state or save as provided by or under this instrument the exercise of any powers, authority and rights now enjoyed by me as a ruler of the state or the validity of of any law at present enforced in this state. I hereby declare and I execute this instrument on behalf of the state in that any reference to this instrument to me or to the ruler of the state is to be construed as including reference to my heirs and successes. And the acceptance you'll also find at 11. I hereby accept this instrument of accession dated this 20th day of October, 27th day of October 1947. Now Mother's, sorry. Mother's now, there is a schedule to this accession which is not in this document. But would my Lord be kind enough to turn to document volume 4, PDF page 176. That has the shedding one. Volume 4 page. Page 176. PDF page 176. Running page 738. PDF page 176. Volume 4. Running page 738. 738. Yes, that's correct. The Unlike states in India which vested under 97 with the union vested in the state. Resilient power did not vested in the union in the relationship of JNK with the union. So it was quintessentially a truly federal marriage, so to say. Actually the resolution which when it was passed by the Constituent Assembly initially contemplated that the Resilient Power would be with the states. Yes. And it was between the time of that resolution and the eventual adoption of the Constitution that the Resiluity Power entry in 97 came to the, came to the center. But they all accepted it. So that's, but here one of this, this issue was somewhat different. that's good. No, but as kindly said, the schedule, defense, naval, military and air forces of the Dominion and any other armed forces raised or maintained by the Dominion, any armed forces, including forces raised or maintained by an exceeding state, which are attached to or operating with any of the armed forces in the Dominion, naval, military and air force works, administration of the Contourment areas, arms fire, arms ammunition, explosives. And external affairs like implementing of treaties, agreements, other countries, extrication, including surrender of criminals, accused persons of parts to parts of the humanities, dominions outside India, admission into an immigration expulsion from India, including in relation to the regulation of the movements in India of persons who are British subjects, now I signed in India or subjects of any exceeding state-built images to places beyond India naturalization, then communications, posts and telegraphs, including telephones, wireless broadcasting, like phones and rainways, et cetera. We need not go into this. Maritime shipping navigation, port, quarantine major ports, and then then whether it's aircraft, lighthouses, carriage or passengers and then ex-ansi-dery elections to the Dominion Legislature subject to the provisions of the act and of any order they're under offenses against laws with respect to any of the opposite matters, inquiries and statistics for the purposes of any of the opposite matters and jurisdiction in part of all courts with respect to any of the opposite matters. Inquiries and statistics for the purposes of any of the opposite matters and jurisdiction in the powers of all courts with respect to any of the opposite matters, but except with the consent of the ruler of the exceeding state, not so as to confer any jurisdiction of powers upon any courts other than courts ordinarily exercising in or in relation to the state. So that's what these subjects, do they correspond specifically to certain entries on the government of India Act? No, they would have the subject. No, but the subject of the state were with reference to those residing in the state. Those who had come to the state, those who were in Pakistan and came back. So that's a 1927 order, which I'll point your watch later. Possibly the subjects which the instrument of accession recognizes in terms of the legislative powers of the Dominion must cover certain specific entries in the government of India Act. So these subjects are for instance different from the people. There would be certain specific entries in the government of India Act with reference to which there was an acceptance. Correct. I would find that out and tell you a lot. Which part of the Government of India Act covers these moves? I appreciate that. Then mothers kindly go back, come back to volume one. Yes. Then come to mothers, reply from Lord Manbhattan to Maharaja Harish. That's at page 12. Page 12. My dear Maharaja Sahib. My government has decided to accept the accession of Kashmir State to the Dominion of India, consistently with their policy that in the case of any state where the issue of accession has been the subject of dispute, the question of accession should be decided in accordance with the wishes of the people of the state. It is my government's wish that as soon as law and order has been restored in Kashmir and a soil declared cleared of the invader, The question of the state succession should be settled by reference to the people. Meanwhile, in response to your Highness's appeal for military aid, action has been taken today to send troops of the Indian Army to Kashmir to help your own forces to defend your territory and to protect the lives, property and honor of your people. My government and I note with satisfaction that your Highness has decided to invite Sheikh Abdullah to form an interim government to work with you, with your Prime Minister. back to the list. you Okay. The page 38 and I've already read to your Lordships, the acceptance letter amount back. So we go to 23, 5th of March, 1948. You want to go back to the list of dates and yes, go back to the list of dates PDF 38 volume 1 What are you reading? Fifth of March, that entry because I've already read the 22nd of October letter of Murad Naan Bhatton on the 5th of March 9th, my Lord has that. Volume 1, PDF page 38. 5th of March 1948. The ruler, you also have that? The ruler, my Raja, I am sorry. Volume 2. Volume 1. Same list of cases I was reading. Sub cases it's volume 2 some. Same level. Yes, fifth of March 1940, the ruler, Naraja Hari Singh issued a proclamation under which a popular, intelligent government was established in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, pending the framework of constitution for the state, proclamation in the inter-area. But it is better we read the whole proclamation. This is at volume six, PDF page 242. That's volume 6 PDF page 242. Volume 6? 42. Say as Merence if you watch it, have it. My God, just so you can't have it. Volume 2? Volume 6. PDA page 242. Running page pages 1291 the one. Running page 1291. That's correct. That's correct. Well, we have to show PDF mothers otherwise it becomes difficult. because . Okay. Yes. The importance of the traditions of my dynasty I have from time to time provided for increasing association of my people with the administration of the state with the object of realizing the goal of full responsible government at as early a date as possible and in pursuance of that object have by the Jammu and Kashmir constitution act 1996 established a constitutional government with the council of ministers. The legislature with the majority that's the Prajapata with the majority of elected members and an independent judiciary. the with a heritory ruler for my dynasty as the constitutional head of an executive responsible to the legislature. I've already appointed the popular leader of my people, Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah, as the head of the emergency administration. It is now my desire to replace the emergency administration by popular interim government and to provide for its powers, duties and functions pending the formation of a fully democratic constitution. Accordingly, hereby, ordain as follows. My council of ministers will consist of the Prime Minister. In such other ministers, there may be appointed to the advice of the Prime Minister. My royal, my royal warrant appointed Sheikh Abdullah as the Prime Minister with effect from today. The Prime Minister and the other ministers will function as a cabinet and act on the principles of joint responsibility. Devan appointed by me should also be a member of the cabinet. I take this opportunity of giving once again a solemn assurance that all sections of my people will have opportunities of service both civil and military solely on the basis of their merit and irrespective of creed and community. My councilor minister shall take appropriate steps as soon as restoration of normal conditions has been completed to convene a national assembly based upon adult franchise, suffrage, having due regard to the principle that the number of representatives from each voting area should as far as practicable be proportional to the population of that area. In a way, if he was adopting the principles, but was adopted by us. The constitution to be framed by the National Assembly shall provide adequate safeguards for the minorities and contain appropriate provisions, guaranteeing for the freedom of conscience, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. The National Assembly, as soon as the work of framing the new constitution is completed, submitted through the council of ministers for my acceptance. In conclusion, I repeat and hope that the formation of a popular interim government and the inauguration of the near future were fully democratic constitution will ensure the contentment, happiness and moral material advancement of the people. So go back to volume two written submissions compilation volume two PDF page 38 again. When 1949 item 24 was there, volume two PDF page 38. I submit to U. Raj Karan Singh who would function as the ruler of the state. We don't have to go to that. Following his appointment as ruler Karan Singh nominated four representatives from Jammu and Kashmir to the Constituent Assembly of India. But the Constituent Assembly actually was formed in 1951. This is the Vizag Constituent Assembly. Sorry. Sorry. Now, December 1947 to September 49, Prince III states underwent a process of integration into the Indian Union by signing merger agreements of covenants of unionization. The state of Jammu and Kashmir was not a part of this process of integration. she's want. United States of Travencore and Cochin, between May 48 to September 49, the states of Saurashtra, Madhya Bharat, Pepsu, Matsya, Rajasthan and Travencore and Cochin signed revised instruments of accession, which inter-ailia and last the powers of the Dominion Legislature, permitting it to enact laws on all matters in lists one and three, the Government of India Act 1925 and cancelled all previous instruments of accession entered into by rulers of princely states, that had entered the governance referred to above. you Mother, your sire may note that no revised instrument of accession was signed by the ruler of Jammu in Kashmir. Just note that fact for us. That's what we're talking about. December 47th, September 1949. Now November 1949, through their respective rulers, Raj Pramok, the states of Saurashtra, Pepsu, Rajasthan, Madhya Bharat, Mysore, and Trivancore, and Pojidumak service, issued proclamations stating that the constitution of India shortly to be adopted by the constitutional assembly shall be the constitution for the state as for other parts of India and shall be enforced as such in accordance with the tenor of its provisions. 25th of November 49 following the proclamations above, Ruga Karan Singh issued a proclamation for the state of Jammu in Kashmir that the constitution of India shortly to be adopted by the constituent assembly in India shall in so far as applicable to the state of Jammu in Kashmir govern the constitution relationship between the state and the contemplated union of India the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state repealing interiorly the Indian Independence Act. Government of India, the relationship between the Constitution and the state of Jambu and Kashmir was governed by Article 370 of the Constitution. It is evident that both the text of Article 370 and the negotiation that preceded its formulation with Article 370 could not be changed unilaterally by Parliament. That's for great significance. Then, Malat 26th of January, 19 1950. Same day, in exercise of Paz under Article 370, sub-article, one of the Constitution, the following consultation with the government of Jammu and Kashmir, the President issue, this is the first Constitution application to Jammu and Kashmir Order 1950. Under paragraphagraph 2 of this order, matters in the first schedule to the order were declared to correspond to matters ceded to the Union of India through the instrument of accession and subsequently the power of parliament to make laws for Jammu and Kashmir was limited to such matters. Furthermore, paragraph 3 of the order declared that in addition to articles 1 and 370 of the constitution, provisions specified in the second schedule to the order would apply to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It's important for us to go to this document. Volume 3 of the documents and Malat's PDF page 470 of the documents and Mollert's PDF page 470. Sorry, page 4, page 4, not 4 the first constitution order. Yes. Well, and kindly note this, this is on the same day, on the Republic Day that you scientists do this. That's of great significance. In exercise of the past conferred by clause one of article 370 of the Constitution of India, the present president in consultation with the government of the state of Jammu and Gautam, it is great to make the following. This order is so and so and so. For the purposes of sub clause B1 of clause one of article 370 of the Constitution, the matters specified in the first schedule to this order being matters in the union union lists, are hereby declared to correspond to matters specified in the instrument of accession governing the accession of the state of Jammu and Kashmir through the union of India, as the matter with regard to which the Dominion Legislature may make laws for the state and accordingly the power of parliament to make laws for the state shall be limited to the matters of Article 1 and Article 370 of the Constitution, the only other provisions of the Constitution which shall apply in relation to the state of Jammu in Kashmir shall be those specified in the second schedule to the order and shall so apply subject to the exception and modifications specified in the set schedule and to the modification that all references in the set provisions to the Raj Prabhup shall be construed as references to the southern area set of Jammu and Kashmir. So, if you look at this first schedule, you will find defense, what I had indicated earlier in the instrument of accession, you will find naval military, then you find delimitation, naval arms, atomic energy, preventive detention, foreign affairs, diplomatic relations, United Nations, participation in international conferences, war and peace, foreign jurisdictions. about 96 items. The number of the interest is the. That's all that I'm saying because the entries in the union list. You read out the second schedule earlier at page 2 if I am not mistaken? Article 72, 1c, 72, 3, 133, 134, 130. That's one more clarification. This is by an order. This is by administrative order. Under Article 370. Yes, yes. That's all. That's what I told you, in the initial stage. Constitution of India as applicable to the state of Janmawan Keshavarod. That's all I meant. That's correct. Namadas Kandesee, these exceptions are 72, 1C, 72, 3, 133, 134, 135, 136, 138, 145, 151. Articles 80 and 81 shall apply subject to the modification that the representatives of the state and the council of states and the house of the people respectively shall apply. The Articles 54-55 should apply subject to the modifications that references therein to the elected members of both houses of parliament and to each elected member of either House of Parliament shall be deemed to include respectively a reference to the representatives of the state in these houses, those houses and to each such representative. The references to the elected members of the legislative assemblies of the state and to each such elected members shall be deemed to include respectively a reference to the members of the constituent assembly of the state and to each such member and that the population of the state shall be deemed to be 44 lakhs and 10,000. Whereas at the moment it's about 14 million, 140 million, that's 14 crores. Now, articles 149, 150 shall apply subject to the modifications that the references therein the state shall be considered, does not improve the state of Jammu-Krishna. Then article 246 shall apply subject to the provisions of paragraph two of this order and clause two and three of article three, 246 shall not apply in relation to the state. So no issue of repugnancy or anything like that. They can't muller for fast laws because the rigidly power of the state. Then 259 shall apply subject to the modifications that after the word until parliament by law otherwise provides the words and the concurrence of the state to such law has been obtained shall be deemed to be inserted. Article 266 shall apply only in so far as it leads to the consolidated fund of India. The so far as they relate to the union and 324 shall apply only in so far as it relates to elections to parliament and to the office of the vice president. So it doesn't apply to the elections in the state. 324, then 335 and then provisions of this part, 361 shall apply only as far as it relates to president, 364, 368 shall apply provided further than no such amendment shall affect in relation to Jammu and Krishna unless applied by order of the president under clause 1 of 370. So, Malaraj, the point that I am making here is very simple, that the government of the day accepted the fact that our relationships with the Jammu and Fesme government are on a separate footing. The provisions of the constitution unless made applicable through a presidential order and agreed to by the government shall not apply. The rigidity power will best in the state. It is the state which must fast laws. Government of India can't under the issue of repugnancy doesn't apply. So whether this status is accepted, that's how 370 came into being. And it continued. Yes, that will come to later. Can the distribution of revenues, Malat's comes in that way, not really concerned with the moment. Now can we come back to Malat's of the written submissions volume two page 41. That's whatmir, he has to seek concurrence. He cannot do it without concurrence. Consultation. So it was a collaborative relationship in a sense. There was a constant dialogue going on. This is what we wish to do and Mullahs consult the state, the state agrees, which is why most of the laws were made applicable. There was hardly any law that was left. So in a sense, they were incorporated separately in the constitution of India in its application to the state of Jammu and Kashmir orders. What happened to currency, for instance? Currency, Mullahs, what the Subway is, the Asad has your lordship knows, Mullahs. Currency. Currency. Currency. Currency was instance. Currency in the Constitution is governed by entry 36 of list 1. But there is no reference to entry 36 of list 1 in theitation order? and the state, after consultation, it was done. The state was at item with the Union, I mean the state itself in its constitution says that we are integrated into India. There was no question. The constitution of Jammu and Kashmir itself says that we are an integral part of India. So where's the question? The only thing that there's a unique structural system in place, a constitutional structure which was in place, which suddenly, on the 6th of August, was done away with. And with the greatest respect, they don't want to use that expression. Suddenly Mullahs in Parliament, it was said that we are doing this at 11 o'clock. Nobody knew about it. There was no consultation of any sort. So it was Mullahs, as I said, the governor of the state and parliament and of course the powers that be, they decided to do this one fine morning and tossed it out. So Malar's 41, the government of India published its white paper on Indian states clarifying the nature of Article 37. The effect of this provision, this is important, we're talking about 1950 itself. The effect of this provision is that the state of Jammu and Kashmir continues to be a part of India. Nobody disputes it. Nobody ever disputed it. It is a unit of the Indian Union. And the Union Parliament will have jurisdiction to make laws for the state on matters specified either in the instrument of accession or by later additions with the concurrence of the government of the state. My Lord has asked me that question. Steps will be taken for the purpose of convening a constituent assembly جو کامیٹ میں ک of India and the state that we will have a constituent assembly which will determine the future course of action. Determine whether or not, in fact 370 should be aggregated at all or not. That decision was with the constituent assembly. Which is why it is called a temporary provision. Not for any other reason. It's in that chapter of the constitution. So this whole argument that this temporary provision was 370 was temporary, no. It was temporary because between 1951... Mr. Sable, what is the date of this white paper? 50. I'll give you... No, you are not given the date. I'm sorry, I'll give you... It's at page 121. Just see the date. We'll just give it to you in a minute. Twenty. I'll give it to you. So Mother. So on the 1st of May 1951 now, Karan Singh, Yubraj Karan Singh issued a proclamation directing the establishment of an elected constituent assembly march. March 1950, I'll give you exactly. It is March 1950s. It cannot be 5th July, it's not 8th. It cannot be. We will give the date. I thought it was March. Article 370 wouldn't have been there. But in any case, the idea is that it's prior to 1951. That's the whole point. Whatever the date is, it is prior to 1951. In other words, the Constitution envisaged a constituent assembly which was to decide as to what would be the fate of Jammu and Krishna. 15th March, 1950 is what I am told. 5. Thank you. you you you They didn't correspond the 1950 of the order didn't correspond, but as if you look at the 50 order, it says para two, for the purposes of sub clause B1 and clause one of 370, matters specified in the first schedule to this order being matters in the union list are hereby declared to corresponds to matters constitution for the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Then 20th of March, 1952, under Article 370, sub-article one of the constitution and following consultation with the government of Jammu and Kashmir, the president issued the consent. 370 for a minute but I will give you a lot of something. Just continue. You are very much, very much. Let's read 370 because the context will be clear. That's how it was understood at that point in time. Yes. It says, Mother, notwithstanding anything in this constitution, the provisions of article 238 shall not apply in relation to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Not 238 minutes per day, per week, per city, per these states. That's what 238 was, so it couldn't apply. It's neither the Union Pist and the concurrent list, which in consultation with the government of the state are declared by the President to correspond to matters specified in the instrument of accession, governing the accession of the state to the Dominion of India as the matters with respect to which the Dominion legislature may make laws for that state. And such other matters in the set lists as with the currents of the government of the state, the president may by order specify. So the items, mothers, communication, defense, foreign affairs in consultation for all matters concurrence, for all other matters concurrence. Explanation. For the purposes of this article, the government of the state means the person for the time being recognized by the president at the Maraja of Damu and Kashmir being acting on the advice of the council of ministers for the time being enforced in office under the Maraja's proclamation dated fifth day of March 1948. This explanation was added later. I'll point that out later. It was amended later on. This particular explanation. The provisions of article, one of this article shall apply in relation to that state. Such of the other provisions of this constitution shall apply in relation to the state subject to such exceptions and modifications as the president may by order specify. Provided that no such order which relates to matters specified in the instrument of accession of the state referred to in paragraph one of sub clause B shall be issued except in consultation with the government of the state. Provided further that no such order which relates to matters other than those referred to in the last proceeding proviso shall be issued except with a concurrence of that government. If the concurrence of the government of the state referred to in paragraph two of sub clause B of clause one, or in second proviso to sub clause D of that clause be given before the constituent assembly for the purposes of framing the constitution of the status convene, it shall be placed before such assembly for just decision as may be taken thereof. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this article, the president may by public notification declare that this article shall cease to be operated or shall be operated only with such exceptions and modifications and from such data he may specify provided that the recommendations of the legislative assembly of the state shall be necessary before the President issues a notification. Constituent Assembly. This now normally is replaced by the Legislative Assembly. The Constituent Assembly. So you had to have a recommendation of the constituent assembly before you could be phase 370. That's what the constitution members themselves thought in 1950 and that operated till 6th of August. How could it change? But how long would the tenure of the constituituent Assembly of the State be? Seven years. So here, Mother, it's 51 to 57. So therefore, with the end of the seven years, the very institution of the Constituent Assembly of the State lapses then. There's no Constituent Assembly left. But then what happens to the proviso? This is the exactly the point mothers. This is exactly the point. In between 51 and 57 the constituent assembly could take that decision. But thereafter there is no question because they have formed the constitution. What happens after the constituent assembly has come come to an end because no Constituent Assembly can have an indefinite life? That's precisely the point mothers. That is my point. The Constituent Assembly in India when it drafted the constitution, can't have a life after the constitution is framed. No, but equally the proviso to clause 3 refers to the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the state. The substantive provision says that The President may by a notification declare that of the state has to be taken. Now what happens at a point of time where the Constituent Assembly of the state ceases to exist? But that's the point the President can't issue such a notification. According to after 57 it can't be done at all. No after 57 it can't be done. Then clause 3 exactly. That is why the temporary provision? There are ways in which you can construe proviso, but if the proviso ceases to operate by virtue of the fact that the tenure of the Constituent Assembly of the state has ceased to exist, surely the substantive part of three still continues to remain. Kindly see the scheme of 370, whereas with the greater statistics, kindly see the scheme of 370 on the four items, that is, defense, communications, external affairs and ancillary matters, the consultation of the state is necessary under 370. For all other matters, the concurrence of the state is necessary. So can you say you do away with the concurrence? And then the third thing is, if you want to abrogate 370, then it's automated, you have to get the recommendation of the constituent assembly. So what you put to me, this, long as it exists. So, in which case then what happens is if your if your construction is right 370 which is essentially a transitional provision assumes the character of a permanent position by virtue of the fact that there is no constitutional assembly of the state after 1957. Absolutely. It's a transitional provision between 1951 and 1957 when the constitutional assembly could take that decision. It was left to the people of Kashmir. Yes. The second part is what the amendments have been made and how do you interpret? Yes. Well, I can't hear your logic. Yes. What is interpretation of clause 3 to article 370 has to be done independently of the amendments. So your contention is the proviso specifically applies and unless the proviso is resorted to and it cannot be resorted to after 1927, clause three will not be applicable. That's your sub and sub. Yes, yes, yes, absolutely. That's absolutely right. That's absolutely right. Whereas just as clause two, three has worked itself out. ملد ایک بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت ب کہ یہ سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ یہ سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سب سے بہت سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کے لئے سکتے ہیں کہ اس کےئی مجھے نہیں تھا۔ جو بہت مجھے تھا۔ Yeah. to accept your submission we will have to postulate that clause 3 becomes a sort of a constitutional article which falls into disuitude after seven years. Yes, yes, absolutely. Who can that be? The clause 3 still continues to survive. The limitation on may not may cease to operate. That's the part 21 Malan. Yes. in place that was invigid by the Constitution in in Malaz, 1950. At that time there was no constituent assembly. Why did they mention constituent assembly? Need not have mentioned it. Finally, can look at it from that point of view. What was the reason to mention constituent assembly in 370 when it was not even in place? They could have said government of Jammu and Kashmir. Why did the constitution makers, mothers, include the term constituent assembly in the instrument of accession that we accept the sovereignty of the Union of India for some limited purposes. They accepted the sovereignty for all intents and purposes. That acceptance of sovereignty was complete, but they reserved certain rights to themselves over certain legislative subjects. So in that sense, the acceptance of sovereignty was complete, but they reserved certain rights to themselves over certain legislative subjects. So in that sense, the accession was complete, the acceptance of sovereignty was complete. Now consistent with that, therefore it said that in clause three that the union of India would have the president of India would have the right to abrogate Article 370. The condition that subject to the recommendation. The You can't say that they have the right sovereign, forget the proviso, even the recommendation of the constitutional assembly which doesn't exist. Then 63, 368 too proviso also goes murals. And the reason is simple murals. The genesis of it was the fact that in 370 itself, it was mentioned that the constitutional assembly has a role to play in the abrogation of 370. Otherwise if your lordship says it had no role to play in the 370, اس کے لئے کنسٹیوانٹر نے سببیوز کیا ہے جموین کشمیر کیا ہے You have to see Malathe historical perspective in the context of Jammu and Kashmir ultimately signed the instrument of accession. Nobody disputes whether they are integrated into India but subjected to a constitutional provision. The It has formed the constitution. Now, if it had decided that they would they would have abrogate 370, the constitutional assembly would have said we have a 370. Which is why it was a temporary provision, not because of the fact that under the the as a union of India, it was dream to be a temporary. How could it be? I, interrupting you at this stage. It does maybe just putting a question. If one looks at Article 370, clause 1B, the power of the parliament to make laws for the state shall be limited to, it says matter in the union list and the concurrent list in consultation with the which in consultation with the government of the states are declared by the president the correspond to matters specified in the instrument of governing the accession to of the state to the that no such order which relates to the matter specified in the instrument of accession of the state referred to in paragraph one of sub clause B shall be issued except in consultation with the government of the state provided further that no such order which relates to matters other than those specified in the last proceeding proviso shall be issued except with the concurrence of the government. So the second proviso talks about concurrence of the government. Now if one looks at clause two, it deals with the situation where the assembly or the government of the state is not there. It's deals with the period when the Constitutional Assembly of the state was in existence but the government or the elected assembly was not in existence. And therefore the proviso to clause three will only be applicable as long as the government of the state or the assembly is not elected because election of the assembly will take place after the constitution assembly of the constitution assembly of that of the state of the state of Jamun Jam and Kashmir, purpose of the constitution of the state which shall be placed before the assembly for such decision as may be taken there on. The constitutional assembly of the state frames the constitution, it goes before the constitution. It can state in the constitution that the 370 is obligated. What problems are there? It has the power? That's why there is a constituent assembly. And it says, Malar, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions, kindly note that. Notwithstanding, Malar 37 B-1 and 37-2, notwithstanding any of that. So, Mueller's, you start the article by saying notwithstanding anything in this constitution and three starts with notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions, that is notwithstanding the opening part of the article also. Yes. Yes, that's the whole point, Malar. That is our case. Then how it is temporary? It is temporary because when this article was framed, Malar, there was no constituent assembly. It was the constituent assembly which could have taken the decision that we will abrogate 370 and merge completely with the union of India like any other state. Because similarly our contention, if I have understood you correctly, is that the temporary nature of 370 is correlatable to the concrete assembly life. That's right. That's my answer. And in a way, sub clause 3 becomes OTOs once the constituent assembly ceases to exist. This is your contingency. My contingency. From 51 to 57 which temporary. Your law says that the constituent assembly, they say the same thing. Mr. Aayam, they say the same thing. What I am saying, Mr. Aayam. I am just trying to phrase it as I understand. The reason is simple. اور وہ اپنے بہترینی ہے۔ سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے سب سے س That's why I started with that summation before your Lordships. The formation of a Constituent Assembly is a political exercise to ensure that people within the territory of a particular region, their aspirations are taking into account to formulate a law and a constitution to ensure that those aspirations are met in future times to come. This is not a law making exercise. Then they framed the constitution to take into account those aspirations. That's how our republic came into force. Because there was the 1935 act, there was diversity. Let's kindly look at it historically. Let's not forget the law for the moment. Look at it historically. If you look at Europe and the making of the nation states in Europe, how did that happen? It happened because there was ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیا ہے کہ ایسا بہترین کیوسرے ایے بارے میں بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے constitutionally in grafted in article 370 and the terms of the exception were constitutionally in grafted in 370. You can't judge the people of the state of Jammu and Kashmir and decide that what's the difference between this and whether it's the act of the crown. What's the difference between this and the annexation of Juna Ghat or the annexation of Hyderabad? Then it's an act of paramountcy that I am the union and I will decide. When you have constitutionally, when you have committed yourself that if this is to be done, you have to follow a process which two sovereign authorities have agreed upon and then grafted in Article 370. Otherwise Manas then, then, then's exercise of paramount power. because the temporary provision was created for a period of time and after that it is engrafted permanently into the constitution. Because you can't revive the constitution. I am just saying what? That's what my example is. I appreciate Manoj. Your lordships have fully understood what I am trying to say. What is it that you have a state of Jammu and Kashmir with today 14 million people? At that time, they were much less. انہوں نے امام ون کشمیر کے ساتھ امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی امامی ام If in 1950 it was part of the union, there would be no issue. The aspirations, the desires of the people, whatever it is, after all this was something that also had international repercussions at that point in time. If a elected SMT would want to aggregate 370, even that is not possible. Not possible, not possible. That is why they had to do these things in the manner that they did. But the only way we can reach to that conclusion is by saying that once the period for the work of the Constituent Assembly of the state comes to an end, then what is essentially a temporary provision assumes a permanent character in the constitution. But that yes, not to be that exact. But if that hypothesis is not accepted, then the only basis on which you can really place your petitions here is that by asserting that a pre-constitution compact which was entered into between an independent state and a state in which it has merged, so to speak, is enforceable irrespective of what the legislative power of the merging state is. Because the legislative power, both of the parliament here cannot overwrite the powers under 356 of the constitution because what has been used is 356. There is no such power under 356 that Kang Malar's state could take over. Can an independent state which accepts the sovereignty of another state unconditionally still say that well if the parliament of that state to which we have assumed sovereignty of is still restrained in terms is the temporary power. What are you trying to say to me? What you are saying you see, which means even let us say a hypothesis that the will of the people is to abrogate it, which is reflected by an assembly election. You are saying even that scenario it cannot be done. Trying to understand the consequence. But that would be a political act then. I would say that if that situation arises it would be a political act. اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپنے ساتھ سکتا ہے کہ اپ of 360 says to restore democracy. Is the intention behind the 356 position which is a temporary provision to decimate democracy? No, let's keep 356 aside for the time being because we are now interpreting. No, I am saying we are interpreting clause 3. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can't bring. No, no, I'm only saying these issues. If I look at it carefully, clause sub clause B to say such other matters in the state list with the concurrence of the government of the state, the president may be by order specified. So all other matters which are not included in clause one. Requirements can be in can be now this the parliament of the country can legislate with the concurrence of the government of the state. Now what is meant by the concurrence of the government of the state. which will have the power and after the state assembly has been constituted, then it will be placed before the state assembly. That's the purpose of clause 2. So that's also worked itself out. But once the state assembly has been constituted in terms of the constitution of the state, then it is governed by the proviso, first and the second proviso to clause one. Which says provided that no such order which relates to matters specified, matters specified so and so, so and so in consultation with the government of the state, concurrence is not required because it's already included in the order of accession. The second proviso applies when it is not included in the order of the accession and says provided further that no such order which relates to matters referred to in the last provision shall be except with the concurrence of the government. So all that is required is concurrence of the government. But to say that the proviso to clause three will operate even after the constitution. This article shall cease to operate, not just any laws that this article shall cease to operate. There's a difference, Malat. Actually, provider one and provider two have worked themselves out because now you have a constitution. Yes, it's not worked itself out. It will continue to apply as long as it is this concurrence of the state government. That's right. And in between the constitution in 1957 is framed. So that there was no CO after that. Except for the ones... There were a couple of COs but ultimately it's in three... It's in... That's it. There is different. No, no. See, it says not to be standing anything in foregoing position of this article. This article. We are interpreting 370. Let's look at it. Let's look at clause B, C and D for a moment. Yeah. B, C and D covered two types of situations. That's one, it covers entries of the union list and the concurrent list. Yes. And it covers substantive provisions of the constitution also. Now, clause B refers to the power of parliament to make laws for the state. And it restricts it in two ways. First, those matters which are governed by the instrument of accession, those entries in the union list and in the concurrent list, which are referable to the instrument of accession in so far as it reserves powers to parliament, those have to be specified by the government of India, by the president in consultation with the state. So, B1 refers to those matters in the union list and the concurrent list. Right. B2 refers to such other matters in the set lists in which concurrence of the government of the state is concerned. Right? So, the entirety of B is confined to matters in the union list and the concurrent list. Correct. Now we come to clause C. Yes. Clause C refers to a substantive article of the Constitution, Article 1. Yes. Right? Now we come to clause D. And 370, not just Article 1. Right. And of this article, you are right. And this article. And now clause D. Clause D refers to such of the other provisions of this article you are right. And this article. is beyond the ambit of clause A, clause A refers only to the entries of the union list and the concurrent list. Right? Clause D refers to the other provisions of the constitution, apart from the union and the concurrent list. One and three seventy. This is the problem. Right. Now, look at the proviso to clause D. Yes. The proviso says that no such order which relates to the matters specified in the instrument of accession of the state referred to in paragraph 1 of sub clause B shall be issued except in consultation with the government of the state. In other words, the first proviso refers to the entries of the union list and the concurrent list. The second proviso provided further that no such order, now which is such order, it refers to the order which is referred to in the first proviso, therefore the use of the word such order, which relates to matters other than those referred to in the last preceding proviso shall be issued except with the concurrence of that government. In other words, the whole area of concurrence, consultation and consent is confined to the entries of the union list and the concurrent list. Because that's very clear from the whole scheme. B1 matters in the union list and the concurrent list. B2 such other matters in the union and the concurrent list. Then go to clause D. Clause D refers to the provisions of parliament or such of the provisions of this constitution shall apply in relation to the state subject to such exceptions and modifications as the president may be able to specify. In other words, the president is given an untrammeled power to specify which are the provisions of the constitution which shall apply to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. That is conditioned by the first provisor and the second proviso. But the first proviso and the second proviso don't relate to the substantive provisions of the constitution at all. They only refer to the matters governed in the union list and the concurrent list. Only the first provido knows. D recognizes as inhering in the precedent the power to decide which of the substantive provisions of the constitution shall apply to Jammu and Kashmir. Now that power of the precedent is conditioned by the first and the second proviso. But the first and second proviso to clause D only... No see why did further that no such order shall relate. So no such order means the order referred to in the first proviso and the first proviso only refers to clause one of sub clause B. I understand that yes. No, no one second. No, no, you're not getting the point. The point is this that D refers to an order which may be passed by the president making applicable provisions of the constitution to the state of Jammu and Kashmir with adaptations or modifications. Now the question including the list, now yes now what the first proviso, Malat. Now the second proviso says provided that no such order which relates to matters other than those referred to in the last preceding proviso. Which includes team, Malat? No, it refers only, it cannot. I'll tell you why. Provided further that no such order, no such order means which order the order referred to in the first proviso and the order He also says the same thing. My order is specified. I'm going to take the. Yeah. Looks off. The Honourable Chief Justice, in the morning I mentioned a matter of urgency, there are 23 protests going on simultaneously. We have a very volatile situation due to very unfortunate situations that happened in the neighbouring state in Haryana and noob. Now there are 23 protests going on in Delhi. Have you circulated your emails? I'll pass orders immediately. Can I hand over hard copies of the IAM? You circulated an email, right? I'll pass orders. But the email went to the Learned Register judicial because we couldn't find another email. It doesn't even allow me to use a washroom. He's waiting just outside to take orders the moment I come to my chamber. Right. We also circulated to the Unville court master your lordships got passed you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Yes. Mullahs, may I just, Mullah, just very simply state what I think is the architecture of 370. Yes. Let's go back to it, Mullah. Notwithstanding anything in this constitution, the provisions of Article 238 shall not reply in relation to Jammu and Kashmir. That's done away with normalcy because those are Part A, Part B, Part C, Part B states. Therefore, Mullahs, that's over. We're not part of any of those states. The power of parliament. Now here, Mullahs, it is relates to the power of parliament to make laws. Just kind of note that. Does the ordinary lawmaking power? Yes, the ordinary lawmaking power for the state shall be limited. That's important. Even the lawmaking power is limited to those matters in the union list and the concurrent list. Your Lordships will see state list is out because the auxiliary power is in the state, which in consultation with the government of the state are declared by the president to correspond to matters specified in the instrument of accession governing the accession of the state to the Dominion of India as the matters with respect to which the Dominion legislature may make laws in that state. So that's that list Malra. We saw the list in the morning. The list in the morning. So it is only those that parliament may make laws but that also with consultation. And consultation is mentioned here itself. Doesn't have to be repeated in the provider. It's mentioned here itself. Correct? That also has to be a consultation. And just point of the mill, let's clarify the architecture. That's with consultation. Now you come to be such other matter that is again, repower parliament to make laws Such other matters in the set list so Apart from the list that are in the instrument of accession Such other matters in the set list this list refers to union and concurrent list. Yes Only list one and three one and three that as with the concurrence of the government So now will us that law has to be also with concurrence of the government. So we are dealing only with laws here. Lawmaking power. That's the first minute limb of the argument. That's the restriction on the lawmaking power. That's the lawmaking power. Concurrents is mentioned here in respect of other matters. No proviso is required. یہاں سب سے بہترانی پاورا ہے۔یک حالت ہے ایک ہے ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک ایک Shall apply in relation to that state subject to such means only that article one and this article will apply only in relation to that. That's all I'm saying. Nothing more. Then read D. D if one reads D. Such of the other provisions correct means one and three seventy as well as other than the matters in the concurrent and the union list correct that also that also I agree at two thirty eight also just one reading of D Yes. Otherwise it will lead to a situation you are saying that 370 is a permanent article. We'll come to that later. Yes, that's your argument. 370 is a permanent article which cannot be undone by even with the concurrence. Let me forget that when I made that argument. Right now you're just giving us the structure of the article. Forget that what I raised that argument. That you're giving us a structure. It is temporary on 26th of January, 1950. Let's forget about anything else. It is temporary. Why? Because, mother, the constitutive families you had chosen to. So it's temporary. There's nothing wrong with that heading. Let me finish. Let me finish the architecture and then I'll come back. So, Mother, I was reading, such of the other provisions of the constitution, so that is other than one and three seventy, shall and two thirty eight shall apply in relation to that state subject to such exceptions and modifications as the president may by order specify. Now you come to orders, not to laws, provided that no such order, what order? Order under D colon, see the colon, specify colon, right? Provided that no such order which relates to the matter specified in the instrument of accession, again, اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے بہترانی کی اپنے پرانی میں اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا ہے کہ اپنے پرانی میں کھوڈی کیا If the concurrence of the government of the state referred to in paragraph two of sub clause B of clause one or in second proviso to sub clause D of that clause be given before the constituent assembly for the purpose of framing the constitution of the state is convened, it shall be placed before such assembly for such decision and maybe taken there on. Same template of B and D mallets and they can reject it. They need not confirm it. That's how you that's how you retain sovereignty, which is the instrument of accession. And if it don't retain it beginning of the article. Please please note that. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this article. So notwithstanding the notwithstanding in 370, the president may by public notification declare that the article shall cease to be operative or shall be operative only with such exceptions and modifications and from such date as he may specify, provided that the recommendation of the constituent assembly shall be necessary before the president issues such a notification. So if the constituent assembly recommends it namely that we want to abrogate 370, then on that recommendation the president will issue a notification. And this article is contained in sub clause 3. It doesn't have to be in D. D1 refers to those matters in the instrument of accession which have been seeded by the Maharaja to the Union, the Dominion's power. B2 refers to all other matters in the Union and concurrent list other than what is covered by what? Now, suppose in the area of the Union and all other list, Malar. Now, suppose it is not covered by B2 in the sense that there is no concurrence of the state, right? It's not covered by B1 and you have not taken the concurrence of the state under B2. On such an aspect, the state legislature cannot exercise power because it's not in the state list. State like one second, I mean, this is a one second. One second. The state legislature, the state legislature is operating on the state list. Residuity power came in and when? I will show that your lot. This is part of the instrument itself. Instrument of accession. Yes, it is part of Malaz. All orders of the government. No, but as specifically there's also part of the constitution. I just wanted to see whether it's what. Yes, yes, yes. You always take it. Otherwise, there'll be a peculiar situation where neither parliament can exercise power nor can the state. I take your lot. His point. I will demonstrate your lordship's the rigidity power was with the state legislature throughout and with the state government throughout that was the condition on which mallards the accession took place and I will demonstrate that your lordship. That's not that's that's the reason my problems is simple slightly different. Yes. Yes. Which is very different from what is subject matter of one and two. Yes, right. Because they do not deal with the aggregation of the article. Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. You are asking this right. And therefore, when we read at that power, which is specifically conferred on the president, 10 provisional, leave aside for the timing the provisional. Do you agree with that interpretation? No, I don't. For the time being, just leave the provisional. I can't read the constitution in this fashion. I can't even act in that fashion. Let's forget the Constitution. How do I leave the proviso in the Constitution is staring us in the face? No, no, no. My question was, therefore, clause 3 deals with abrogation of the article itself, which is not the subject matter of 1 and 2. No, it's subject matter of C, article 1 shall apply to the state. Correct. But it deals with complete abrogation of the article itself. I agree. And in that context, you may argue that your argument at the first fold was it will be only if the condition of the proviso is satisfied that 3 clause 3 will apply otherwise if the conditions of the proviso are not satisfied, clause 3 will not apply. That now your lordships have interpreted proviso since 1950. That's all that I can say. I can't see more than that. provided that the recommendation of the legislative of the constituent assembly shall be necessary. It's a restriction on the exercise of power. That's what I've referred to interpret clause 3 to say that the power existed and then will vanish once the Constitutional Assembly of the State referred to in para 2 sub clause B or 1 or the second proviso to D of that clause be given before the constituent assembly for the purpose of framing of the constitution of that's the purpose. Mr. Sibley, you have contradicted yourself. When it's referred to clause C, sub clause C is an independent clause and clause D not applicable to clause C. Then the second proviso will not apply. And therefore only. No, no, there is there is something that's missing. The proviso says provided that the recommendations are constituents assembly of the state referred to in clause two. Why are they saying that? The purpose is given in clause two provided that the recommendations are constituents assembly of the state referred to in clause clause two shall be necessary for the president before the president before the president issues such a notification. It is necessary in actual and before he issues it. How can you say it's explanatory or that it's it's it's an independent clause. It's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it of the State referred to in clause 2 is because clause 2 refers to the Constituent Assembly for the purpose of framing the Constituent. That's correct. That is exactly my point. That is your point. You get that point. Now, therefore, the reference, the recommendation of which constituent assembly, this makes it very clear that one and only constituent assembly which was formed for the purpose of framing of the state constitution. Once the frame of the constitution was done, then that purpose of the constitution assembly is not like a permanent body like parliament is a permanent body, the Supreme Court is a permanent body. No doubt about it. It's a body which has a specific purpose and then after it becomes function of official to speak. Therefore, once the constitution assembly had fulfilled its purpose, then the proviso itself has no application. This is the problem there is, then you are applying three without the proviso and saying this is a blanket power, then it's a, then the president can do it anytime without without any constant. It's just a order. I integrate. I integrate. That's that one thing which we can also bear in mind is all these provisions are in part 21. Part 21 has used three expressions. Temporary, transitional and special. Temporary provisions are those which are intended to be in existence for a limited period of time, but without a point of terminus, a temporary government servant, that person is temporary for a limited period of time, but whose services are to be terminated until you are terminating the services of that person that person still continues That's that broad concept enough temporary. Absolutely. Transitional means something which necessarily has a terminus. That's right. I'll show you some of the transitional provision this part and third is special. Now we'll see for instance after 370 we'll get some idea from the provisions after 370. Say 371, special provision with respect to Maharashtra and Gujarat. 371a, special provision for Nagaland. Then we get 371b, special provision for Assam. 371c, special provision for Manipur. D for the state of Andhra Pradesh Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.A, power of the president to adapt laws. And it says the president may by order made before the 1st of November 1957, make such adaptations and modifications. So this was a transitional provision that the president had to make those adaptations by the 1st of November 1957. So it was a transitional provision. After that the power lapses. So similarly, 373 was then came the provisions relating to the judges, judges who has whose services had to be taken over by the Union of India, public service commissions, so on and so forth. And then from 392, the power of the president to remove difficulties. So therefore, part 21 basically covers special provisions, temporary provisions and transitional provisions. Now, it doesn't use the expression transitional in any head note, a marginal note to the articles, but temporary and special are used in the marginal notes to specific articles of part 21 and 370 specifically uses the expression temporary. Track 2 Malat. No. Can we then by reading by saying that the power under clause 3 goes once the Constituent Assembly comes to an end, really convert this into a permanent provision which it was never intended to be Malar. They will know there's nothing there at that point in time. It had to be Malar. It could never be a permanent thing. So why did the constitution then put it in part 21? Because Malar jit is a separated, it relates to a particular state where the two sovereigns have come together and made a compact which is incorporated and it did get into... Part 21 does not deal only with the... It doesn't deal only It deals with other countries. Part 21 does not temporary. 3 respect to temporary provisions. In other words, this is a provision which is temporary till such time as the constituent assembly decides this way or that way. That's the whole purpose mothers. Because when the constitution came into force, there was no such thing as the constituent assembly even. How did the constitution add this here? Because there was an understanding. Otherwise, why would you bring in the term constituent assembly in 370? It's not anywhere else. To the temporary, supposing, not that I should say so, because one never knows, supposing the constituent assembly decided not to be with India. Then what happens? You would have to do what we did to Jhunagat. There are two types of temporary provisions in part 21. One type is Article 369. 369 says Parliament had the power to make laws for a period of five years on certain matters, even if they may not be in the concurrent. Absolutely. So they were temporary with reference to time. They were temporal. I agree. Then 370 is an illustration of a case which is temporary in the sense it will, we are not, whether this is not something that we believe we are totally integrated into India, that's not an issue. We are, we have said so. Therefore, there is no, as far as... I mean, our constitution says we are an integral part of India. So where's the question of moving away apply we'd like to be like any other state. Then They don't have to make a constitution of their own. Then they don't have to make a constitution of their own. Indian constitution of their own. Once again. They don't have to make a constitution of their own. The constitutional assembly would say, we integrate into India. We're part of India. We're like any other state. We don't need a constitution. And all those lists will apply. That power is there. So why was it called a temporary provision? Because that had to be decided by the constitutional assembly. جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو Because it was unlike any other state. The rigidity power was always with the state. In the Delhi agreement in 1952 I have a recent... The 70 came in with the original constitution. Yes. Is there anything in the Constituent Assembly debates which first lies on why they introduced it? I'll do that straight away. Yes, I'll give you a lot of such that. Exactly what I'm saying is what they said. Let us see the volume H. Yeah. Pdf page 1173. It's okay. 1174 actually. Volume 8, Pdf page 1174. 1174. Pdf 1174. 4035. Running page 4035. 4035. Yes, running page. But PDF 1174. Volumetric. Volumetric. By now we know, we know your Lordship's illicit answers in order to find out what we wish to say, not that your Lordships have ever decided on one way or the other. We always do that and I've seen... In the last word is said, you know, Madam, everything is open. When the printed word comes, that's the last word. I always said, Mr. Sibyul, the judge is very quiet, there is a problem. that your line of reasoning is wrong because you know when you dictate the logical syntax has to fall in place when you know you are engaged with yourself then you know it's not going to fit in like this. Quite frankly, Milla, I'll be honest when I looked at it myself I asked this question that your lordships is asking. I asked myself that question. 403 forms. Yes, 403. 1174. Yes Yes 1174. Then kindly come to Muller's the sentence starting. Sir this matter you are watching that. They set out Muller's. Gopal Swami Anga. Yes I am Gopal Swami Aayu? The state has acceded to the Dominion of India. The history of this accession is also well known. The accession took place on 26th October 1947. Since then the state had a checkered history. Conditions are yet not normal. The meaning of this accession is that the present, that at present the state is a unit of a federal state, namely the Dominion of India. This Dominion is getting transformed into a Republic which will be inaugurated on 26 January, 1950. The Jammu and Kashmir State therefore has to become a unit of the new Republic of India. As the House is aware, accession to the Dominion always took place by means of an instrument which had to be signed by the ruler of the state and which had to be accepted by the Governor General of India. That has taken place in this case as the house is also where instruments of accession are a thing of the past in the new constitution will be a thing of the past in the new constitution. The states have been integrated with the federal republic in such manner that they do not have to exceed or execute a document of accession for the purpose of becoming units of the republic. But they are mentioned in the constitution itself. And in the case of practically all states other than the state of Jammu and Prasimil, their constitutions also have been embodied in the constitution for the whole of India. And all those other states have agreed to integrate themselves in that way and accept the constitution provided. The discrimination is due to the special... Why this discrimination? That's the question asked. The discrimination is due to the special conditions of Kashmir. That particular state is not yet ripe for this kind of integration. It is the hope of everybody here that in due course even Jammu and Kashmir will become ripe for the same sort of integration as has taken place in the case of other states. At present it is not possible to achieve that integration. There are various reasons why this is not possible. Now, I shall refer again to this a little later. In the case of other Indian states or union of states, there are two or three points which have got to be remembered. They all accepted the constitution framed for states in part one of the new constitution and those provisions have been adapted so as to suit conditions of Indian states and union of states. Secondly, the center that is the Republican federal center will have power to make laws applying in every such state or union to all unions and concordant subjects. Thirdly, a uniformity of relationship has been established between those states and unions and the center. Kashmir's conditions are as I have said special and require special treatment. I do not want to take much time in the house but I shall briefly indicate the special conditions are In the first place, there has been a war going on within the limits of Jammu and Kashmir. There was a ceasefire agreed to at the beginning of this year, and that ceasefire is still on. But the conditions in the state are still unusual and abnormal. They have not settled down. It is therefore necessary that the administration of the state should be geared to these unusual conditions until normal life is restored. Part of the state is still in the hands of rebels. بہت سے بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت بہت سے کشمیر پروڈنم کو بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی بھی ب or wish to go out of it. We are also committed to ascertaining the will of the people by means of a plebiscite provided that peaceful and normal conditions are restored and the impartiality of the plebiscite. This is not relevant anymore. This is not relevant. The plebiscite issue is not relevant. the union jurisdiction will be state. That's why it was a temporary privilege. Now the next paragraph. At present the legislature which was known as the Prajapraja Sabha in the state is dead. Neither the legislature nor a constituent assembly can be convoked. Orc and function until complete peace comes to prevail in the state. We've therefore to deal with the government of the state which has represented by its اپنے حالت کو حکم اور حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو حکم کو arrangement is possible, which is why it is temporary and not an arrangement which could at once be brought into line with the arrangement that exists in the case of other states. This tells your Lordships why it is temporary. Now if you remember the viewpoints that I have mentioned, it is inevitable conclusion that at the present moment we could establish only an interim system, interim system, article 306A as now what is 306A? 370. Is an attempt to establish such a system. Interim till the constituent assembly decides. I shall now proceed whether that's not reasonable. So clearly, clearly gives you an indication why it was in term, it gives you an indication why it was temporary. Because there was nothing in place. Registration was not working, constituency was not in place and the will of the people had to be taken, which was reflected in the constituent assembly. Therefore it was temporary. اور بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہت سے بہتر بہت سے 373 بہت سے کہتے ہیں کہ آپ کو اپنے کسٹیٹوٹ رکمانیت کی رکمانیت کی رکمانیت کیا ہے کہ دیواریت کیا ہے کہ دیواریت کیا ہے کہ دیواریت کیا ہے کہ کسٹیٹوٹن کیا ہے کہ کسٹیٹوٹن کیا ہے کہ Then kindly come to 4039. Second paragraph of 4039. Yes, that's. Now it's very interesting. Let's read the paragraph then we come to clause 2. First that and then I'll read the other paragraph. Then we come to clause 2. My loads have that. That's PDF 1178. 4039. That's right. Just call them. Numbers actually. Maybe I should start start volume 8 1176. Let's take 1176 PDF 1176 running page 4037. Most of your Lordship's questions, whether hopefully are answered in this. There's the second portion of this article, 1076, Yes. It says, Malat. I shall now proceed to take the house through the provisions of this article. That's 306A, which is 370. As honorable members will remember, the Constitution of Indian States is mainly governed by Article 211A of this Constitution, which applies to the Constitution to Indian States. The Constitution of Indian States, subject to the modifications contained in Part 6A, shall be. So far far as that provision is concerned I've already indicated to you that the provisions regarding the Constitution of other states would not at present be applied to Jammu and Kashmir. Therefore clause one of A of this article says that the provisions of 211A of his constitution shall not apply to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. That's 238 months. 211 is 238. The second portion of this article relates to the legislative authority of parliament. So parliament may by law. That's B over the state of Jammu and Kashmir. This is governed primarily by the instrument of accession. Broadly speaking, that legislative power is confined to the three subjects of defense, foreign affairs and communications. But as a matter of fact, these broad categories include a number of items which are listed in the instrument of accession. I believe they include, I believe their number some 20 to 25. Now these items have undergone a change in description in numbering and arrangement as amongst themselves in list one and list three of the new constitution. It is therefore necessary that the items mentioned in the instrument of accession should be brought in line with the change designations of entries in the lists one and three of the new constitution. So clause one B of 306A says that this listing of items as per the terms of the new constitution should be done by the president in consultation with the government of the state. That explains one B1. Clause B2 refers to possible additions to the list in the instrument of accession. And these additions could be made according to the provisions of this article with the concurrence of the government of the state. The idea is that even before the constituent assembly meets, it may be necessary in the interest of both the center and the state that certain items which are not included in the instrument of accession would be appropriately added to the list in that instrument so that administration, legislation and executive action might be furthered and as this may happen before the constituent assembly meets the only authority from whom we can get consent for the addition in the government of the state that is provided. Then there is the explanation which defines what the government of the state means. The government of the state is defined both in the constitution which is now supposed to be in the force in Jammu and Kashmir. The state as well as the proclamation with the Maharaja issued on 5th March 1948, the terms of which are as follows. Then kindly come to, now kindly come to CND. Yes. Second last paragraph in 1177, PDF 1177. 4038. But what has that? C and D refer to the provisions of the Constitution other than matters listed in 1 and 3. These various provisions have been divided into certain categories. The first according to this draft is that article one of the constitution will automatically apply. As you know it describes the territory of India and includes among those territories all the states mentioned in part 3 and Jammu and Kashmir is one of the states mentioned in part 3. With regard to the other provisions in the constitution, these will apply to the Jammu and Kashmir state with such exceptions and modifications as maybe decided on when the present issues in order to that effect. That order can be issued with regard to subjects mentioned in the instrument of accession only after consultation with the government of the state. With regard to other matters, concurrence of the government has to be taken. That's B1 and B2. Two provisors. Two provisors, B1 and B2. That order can be issued in regard to subjects mentioned in the instrument only after consultation, in regard to the other that concurrence. Now it is not the case nor is it the contention of the members of Kashmir government whom I took opportunity of consulting before this draft was finalized. It's not their intentions or the the case, nor is it the intention of the members of the Kashmir government whom I took the opportunity of consulting before this draft was finalized. It's not their intention that the other provisions of the constitution are not to apply. That particular point of view is that these provisions would apply only in cases where they can suitably apply and only subject to such modifications and exceptions in the particular conditions of Jammu and Kashmir may require. I wish to say that no more about that particular point in the present moment. Then we come to clause two. You will remember that several of these clauses provide for concurrence of the government of Jammu and Kashmir State. Now these relate particularly to matters not mentioned in the instrument of accession. And it is one of our commitments to the people and government of Kashmir that no such additions should be made except with the consent of the constituent assembly which may be called in the state for the purpose of framing its constitution. In other words, what we are committed to is that these additions are matters for determination by the constituent assembly of the state. This is commitment. Now you will recall that in some of the clauses of this article we have provided for concurrence of the government of the state. The government of the state feel that in view of the commitments already entered between the state and the center, they cannot be regarded as final authorities for the giving of this concurrence. Though they are prepared to give it in the interim periods. But if they do not give this concurrence, this clause, if they do give this concurrence, the clause provides that that concurrence should be placed before the constituent assembly when it meets and the constituent assembly will take whatever decision it likes to take. What can be clearer than this? The last clause refers to what may happen later on, which is why it's temporary. So the paragraph which you read is with reference to clause two, not with reference to clause three. Yes, yes, I'm not saying that. I am just reading. The last clause is clause three. I am not saying, I'm saying, I'm reading it holistically so you know why it is called temporary. Two and three are temporary. Two and three are temporary, no doubt about it because they have to be actually agreed upon by the legislature, by the constituent assembly. Now C3. The last clause refers to what may happen later on. We have said article 211A which is 238A will not apply to Jammu and Kashmir. But that cannot be a permanent feature of the constitution of the state and hope it will not be. So the provision is made that when the constituent assembly of the state has met and taken its decision, both on the constitution for that state and on the range of federal jurisdiction over the state, the president may on the recommendation of the constituent assembly issue an order that this article 306A shall either cease to be operative or shall be operative only subject to such exceptions and modifications as we specified by him. But before he issues any order of that kind, the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly will be a condition precedent. That explains the whole of the article. Whereas how can there can be nothing clearer than this? I mean, we in hindsight sitting in 2023 can't interpret a provision except on its terms. We're here to interpret the Constitution. We're not here to legitimize a process which is inconsistent with the express terms of the constitution. Next paragraph. The effect of this article is that the Jammu and Kashmir state, which is now a part of India, will continue to be a part of India, will be a unit of the future federal republic of India. And the union legislator will get jurisdiction to enact laws on matters specified either in the instrument of accession or by later addition with the concurrence of the government of the state. And steps have to be taken for the purpose of convening a constituent assembly in due course, which will go into the matters I have already referred to. When it comes to a decision on the different matters, it will make a recommendation to the president who will either abrogate 306A or direct that it shall apply with such modifications and exceptions the constituent assembly may recommend. That, sir, is briefly a description of the effect of this article and I hope the House will carry it. This explains several things. One, why it was a temporary provision. Two, Constituent Assembly had not been constituted then. It was envisaged in our constitution. اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے And a precondition of that would be a recommendation of the constitution of the Constitutional Assembly for the president to pass on. Absent that it can't be done. That was the understanding of the lawmakers, of the constitution, makers of India, of the Constitutional Assembly. That is why it was put in. It was not a temporary provision in the sense that it had ultimately 370 had to be abrogated. That's not the meaning of the temporary provision that we're talking about. In any case, a heading of an article can determine the content of the article. اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے اپنے of article 370 and according to me through a political act not a constitutional procedure declared that 370 is gone. That's why I said it was tossed out of the window through a political act, not through a constitutional act. Such a political act cannot be determined by the parliament of India. It's not in the remit of the parliament of India to take a political decision to abrogate 370. Now we'll demonstrate as we move along with us how it was done and in what manner it was done. Nobody can deny that the people of Jammu and Kashmir are with the union. It's an integral part. Nobody can deny that. But there is a special relationship. There is a unique relationship which is engrafted in 370 itself. You can't jettison that except by following a process which is ordained by law. Some of the lawsuits asked me on the constitution I wanted to just mention. These are the, these are the details. Ambulance. Yeah. you ᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠᶠლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ Here, come out of this. Okay. Still, we hear more. You can please stop. you you you you you you you you you you you you I just want to mention that all the amendments sought Mullahs were all rejected and withdrawn. Not moved. Not moved. Yes. So Mullahs, let me go back to the list of dates now. Now that I have Mullahs put my submission on Article 370 straight away. Let's go back to the list of dates Mullahs were in Pyrrhus. Well, as kindly come to my written submissions volume two and the PDF page is 41. Same page that I left. You are on the list of dates and the serial where you left. Yes, that's right. Unless we have a clear picture of 370, it will be difficult to. Item 33, page PDF 41. So we can't find it. Yes. Under 370s of Article 1 of the Constitution and following consultation with the government of Jammu and Kashmir, the president issued the Constitution application of Jammu-Kashmir Amendment Order 39, modifying Articles 54-55 of the Constitution as long as they applied to state of Jammu and Kashmir constituent assembly submitted its interim report to the Jammu and Kashmir constituent assembly and recommended that the form of the future constitution of Jammu and Kashmir shall be wholly democratic. The institution of hereditary rulership shall be terminated. The office of the government of India and the government of Jammu and Kashmir. Under this agreement, the government of India agreed that while residuity powers of the legislature vested in parliament in respect of other states, in the case of Jammu and Kashmir, such powers vested in the state itself. This is what by law asked me the question. Nomad has kindly read this document. It's very important. Volume one of the compilation of documents, pages 13, PDF 13. One second. One second. The Delhi Agreement 1952. This is Mahatma's page 13, a PDF 13. This does not seem to be the main agreement. This seems to be some summary of the features of the agreement. Yes, it's a summary of what happens. What happens, what the features are. Where is this summary taken from? Because the authenticity will depend on that. The very next page is there mother I believe. This is Sheikh Mohammed of Lula statement to the constituent assembly on the Delhi agreement on 11th August 1952. That's at PDF 16. That's the accurate strength. Yes, I can read that. I can read that. That's not the original either. I'll get you the original. They'll the extract from the original. I show. What is that P? 13 is an extract of the original. Summary actually. This is not something that will be. Government of India agreed that while the regulatory part of the legislature vested in the center and respect of all states other than Jammu and Kashmir, in the case of the latter, they vested in the state itself. It was agreed between the two governments that in accordance with Article 5 of the Indian Constitution, persons who have their domicile, were not concerned with so much, with the domicile issue. And I can read it. the How southern Assad has to be determined was whether the chapter on fundamental rights should form a part of the state constitution of the constitution of India as applicable to the state. So it was not Mullah's apply at that time. With regard to the Jews, they leave that out on the Supreme Court. And then Mullah, there was a great deal of discussion item eight. With regard to the emergency powers, the government of India insisted on the application of Article 352, empowering the president to proclaim a general emergency in the state. State government argued that in the exercise of its powers over defense, item one of the union list, in the event of war and external aggression, the government would have full authority to take steps and proclaim emergency. But the state delegation was, however, averaged to President exercising the part of proclaiming a general emergency on account of internal disturbance, which ultimately your Lordship knows was also taken out of the Indian Constitution under 352. At the relevant time, it was there at the relevant time, but the state said we will not allow it to be exercised. Is this trying to think about at the relevant time in 75. Yes, it was there. It was there. It was very much there. And this through some subsequent orders, it equally applied to Jammu and Krishna. That's correct. Absolutely correct. This summary which my friend was doing Delhi Agreement summary, this has seems to have been taken out of this book a lot of and justice case Anand. It's not publicly available, Justice Anand has that one. It's published. No, no, no. The agreement is not publicly available. So he has given the authoritative statement in sense, what does it imply? This is also part of the compilation. Yes. Yes. Yes. Then, in order to meet the viewpoint of the state delegation, government of India agreed to the modification of 352 in its application to Kashmir by the additional of the following words, but in regard to internal disturbance of the request or with the concurrence of the government of the state. That's how it is. But the parties agreed that the application of 356 dealing with suspension of the state constitution and 360 dealing with financial emergency was not necessary. Right. in regard to the constitutional relationship with Jamu Kashmir and the Indian New Mayor. As the honorable members are aware during the last session of the constituent assembly, the basic principles committee had submitted a report making certain specific recommendations about the future head of the state. House, while accepting these recommendations, had charged the drafting committee to present for the consideration of the assembly a draft resolution incorporating the proposed principles for the election of the head of state. The drafting committee will no doubt submit its report to the House. Since the changes proposed in the Assembly involve corresponding adjustments in the Indian Constitution, the Government of India desired that it should have time to discuss with other representatives, other matters pertaining to the constitutional relationship of our state, with the union during the last stage of these discussions that became necessary for me and some of my other colleagues in the government who participate in the talks. I am now in a position to inform the House that certain broad principles have been laid down and certain decisions have been tentatively arrived at between the two governments. The basis of our relationship with India is the instrument of accession which enabled our state to enter into a union with India in accordance with the terms of instrument of the instrument certain parts were transferred to the center the principal matter specified with the purpose and respect with the Dominion Legislative Committee clause for the state word. They arranged this arrangement, the arrangement involved a division of sovereignty which is the normal feature of a federation beyond the past transferred to it by to the union the the state enjoyed complete, the residues are over it. That's why when you read 370 you can't read into it, but as other matters. These terms of the association of our state with the Dominion were maintained and subsequently when the constituent assembly of India was charged with the task of framing a constitution, this overriding consideration is kept in view in determining the position of the state in the proposed constitution. Earlier to this, it had been agreed between the two governments that in view of the special problems arising in respect of the state and the fact that the government of India have assured its people, they themselves finally determined their political future. A special position should be accorded to Jammu and Kashmir in the future constitution. So the limited field of the union powers over the state is in short. Our representatives were dominated by the Jammu and Kashmir state of the constituent assembly of India. These representatives participated in the deliberation of the assembly in India at a time when the bulk of the Indian constitution had already been adopted. It was at this stage that the constitutional position of the state was determined in the constitutional view. That is very important. It was in collaborative exercise, a dialogue. It was not muddits behind the back of the union or anything like that. They knew what was to happen in the future. Representatives of Jammu and Kashmir reiterated their view that our association with India should be based on the terms of the instrument of accession. It was at this stage that the constitutional position was determined. The representatives of the Jammu-Kashmir state reiterated their view that our association with India should be based on the terms of the instrument of accession. It was also made clear that while the accession of Jammu and Kashmir State within India was complete, in fact, and law to the extent of the subjects enumerated in this instrument, the autonomy of the state with regard to all other subjects outside the ambit of the instrument of accession should be preserved. He wins a good deal of confused thinking and the uninformed criticism is indulged in some interested people. I would like to point out that the constitutions The This is Kwey Madat's the concurrent list matters. the constituent assembly for the Jammu and Kashmiri state, which would finally be competent to determine the ultimate position of the state in respect of the sphere of its accession, which would be incorporated as in the shape of permanent provisions of the constitution. That's why temporal. The rest really need not trouble your own ships. Then, but it's rigidly powered, it's important. Page 19, PDF 19. There is a heading of the Constitution of India and the instrument of accession on which this article is based. We've always held that the ultimate source of sovereignty resides in the people. It is therefore from the people that all powers can flow under these circumstances. It is up to the people of Kashmir through this assembly to transfer more powers, mutual advantage, the custody of the union. So what happens ultimately, and I'm just, since I will come to that later, is that parliament exercised the will of the people of Jammu and Krishna, when they abrogated the art. That's what happened. They took upon themselves جب وہ اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بارے میں بھی جو اپنے بارے میں بارے میں بارے میں بارے میں بارے میں ب and we will exercise the will of the people of state of Jammu and Kashmir to say that we have to get three seven. In essence that what happened? Is that possible constitutionally? Is that envisaged by three seventy? Is this not an exercise of political power? Without reference to 317? And can such a power be exercised in the manner in which it was exercised? That's a matter of procedure. Then there is citizenship, we need not go into it fundamental rights, we don't have to go into all this. It has now kindly come to list of dates again. Right, back at 42 months. Item 37. Article 370 sub article 3, the PDF matters 42. And our justice Kavai has it. Yes, but deserve. even though I say it to myself, a good student because I can access it immediately. This is my second constitution. So I had to learn. Yes. 37 years under article 370 sub article 3 of the constitution, the president after the recommendation of the JNK assembly issued notification 44 modifying 370 to include an explanation that the phrase state government meant the Saudi Arabia's acting in aid and advice of the council. I only that. That was done by the constituent assembly. That's the only time unless they exercise their powers. With reference to 370. On 14th of May 1954, with the concurrence of the government of Jammu and Kashmir, the president issued the constitution adaptation to Jammu-Kashmir order 1954, which came into force on May 14, 1954. This order superseded the constitution application to Jammu-Kashmir order of 1950, which had only those limited provisions. Paragraph two of the said order set those provisions of the constitution, which in addition Articles 1 and 370 because that order only had Articles 1 and 370 would be applicable and other than one, sorry, other than one would be applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Notably, a second proviso was introduced into Article 3 as applied to the state of Jammu and Kashmir in the following terms provided that no bill providing for increasing or diminishing the area. This is also very important. Of the state of Jammu-Kashmir, altering the name or boundary of that state shall be introduced in parliament without the consent of the legislature of that state. So the Lordship knows, Mullahs, Article 3, they can change the boundaries. What happened in this case was, not that they changed the boundaries Mullahs, they converted it into a union territory, which is the other problematic issue, which of course we'll have to argue later. You can change the boundaries of a state, you can bifurcate the boundaries of a large state into smaller states, but never in the history of this country has the state been converted into a union territory. You can carve out a union territory out of a state. You can carve out, but you can't have all of Madhya Pradesh being in unionory tomorrow. Understanding the assurance that on a 70 election being held, the Jammu and Kashmir will be a state. No, that's true. But what they have converted it into a unity as of now. I mean, that's unthinkable. And under the article for Jammu and Kashmir, there was a special provision that that had to be consented to. That was also not done. اور اگر جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیدہ جو بہت سیزی جانتے ہیں ان 2019 میں 2019 میں 2019 میں 2019 میں 2019 میں 2019 میں 3 منتوں بعد یہ ایک ساتھ ہوتا ہے ایک ساتھ اکٹوبر اکٹوبر نویمبر دیسمبر میں 6 اکٹوبر نویمبر دیسمبر میں آپ پارلمانچی ایک ساتھ ہوتا ہے تو آپ پارلمانچی ایک ساتھ ہوتا ہے لیکن آپ ایک ساتھ ہوتا ہے May, you have parliamentary elections. So you can hold parliamentary elections, but you will not hold state elections. But that's why I'm moving away from that to another issue altogether. So, Malaat, then, then, 39, 1711, 1956, the constituent assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, an exercise of its constituent powers, approved and adopted the constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, which is why I started off with the proposition that the concept of a constituent assembly is a political exercise. That political authority, that political body can decide on the future of the state, could have decided on the future of the state. But that's a political decision. You want to abrogate 370, abrogate 370. You want to go integrate into India completely, say we don't need a constitution. But that's a political act. That political act cannot be exercised by parliament, by a legislative body. Because that legislative body is controlled by the constitution and its functions are controlled by the constitution. It can't go beyond that. Which is why I That's declared in the constitution. Nobody can question that. Nobody need question that. Nobody can say that we are not being regarded as we were not saying that we are not an integral part of India. Article one applies. Article one applies and the Constitution defined that relationship. And having defined that relationship, you can't just judge a certain age. Section five of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir provided that the legislative power of the state extended to all matters except those with respect to which parliament had power to make laws for the state under the Constitution of India as applicable. Sorry, as applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Legislative powers in the state would lie with the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council significantly. Section 147 which dealt with amendments to the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir provided that no bill or amendment seeing to change the provisions of the constitution of India as they applied to Jammu and Kashmir would be introduced or moved in either of the state legislations. They had no authority once the constitution had come into force and the orders passed. Then on 21 11 1964 the Constitution application to Jammu Kashmir Third Amendment order of 1964 that is CO 71 which amended the 54 order made article 356 applicable to the state with one notification that the expression included the constitution, sorry, sorry, it's all the same. It's included the constitution of Jammu and Krishna. It's included, yes. Included the constitution of Jammu and Krishna. You can just give the list. Volume 3, you have all the orders. You have now made your point on this. So all the orders. I'm not going to, I'm not asking your Lord just to go through. I'm not even going to read it. We're not, we're not going to go into all this. 54 orders are to the 54 order. That's what it is. 42? Yeah, what is it next? My lord is saying that out. you you Item 43, yes, the watchers don't mind, it's PDF 44. The Kashmir Accord, now that's a political document. 1975 was entered into my Lord's having. My Lords have it. Why was it required to say it is to be governed if it's a political accord, Mullahs. I mean, it has no legal basis that way, but it tells you of the intent of the signatories, Mullahs. Yes, I know that. In any case, 75 is a momentous time in the history of this country. Yes. Luckily, yes. You could. you you And they'll put ultimately 14 years. The background is mothers that whenever he came out, he was saying that no, no, give us autonomy, give us autonomy. It is in that context that the accord was there, that you can't get out of 370. That's really the background to it. He was put in jail even by Mrs Gandhi. So, the rest of the list of dates. Kindly now see come to straight to PDF 47. On On 29th of March 2017, then of course the clamoring began to remove 370, do away with 370. That's a separate issue, we are not concerned with that. That's Suri Akhand. Yes. Member of parliament Ratnaan Denag raised the question whether the minister of law and justice as to whether the government proposes to amend and remove 370 related to Jammu and Kashmir in the near future. If so, details thereof. It's not the reason, therefore, whether this will help in providing equitable justice to the people of the state. And so the details will be up. Minister of State and Law and Justice, so and so present there is no such proposal under consideration. These are only proposals, no, no, no, no, no, throughout but it goes on, Mollad's. Then 57 is Mollad's section 92, this is important. Item 57. Section 92 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir deals with provisions. In case of a failure of the constitutional machinery in the state, the vision permitted the governor to by proclamation assume to himself all the powers and functions of the government of the state. Such a proclamation would in terms of 925 require the concurrence of the President of India under 1923 would cease to operate six months after it was issued. On June 22, 2018, the governor with the concurrence of the President issued a proclamation under 92, declaring governor's rule in the state. This is important. Now we are coming to the present controversy. We can do it tomorrow. Oopsie.
