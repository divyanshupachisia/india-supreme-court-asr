 
 
Mr. Sibal, before we begin, perhaps we can have 
some assessment from your side on the time schedule. So that time schedule and order of 
submissions so that we have some broad idea. So we take it that... 
There is a bit disorder at this side, My Lords, on that point. But we shall tell 
Your Lordships...  
Alright. So roughly Mr Sibal, how long... would 
you be arguing first? After you who would be arguing Mr. Sibal? 
Gopal, My Lords.   
Alright. Mr. Subramaniam [Sankaranarayanan] 
is going to be arguing after that. Then  Dr... 
Then I think Dr. Dhavan [Dave] My Lords.  
Now the time estimate. I would suggest that we'll 
give a fairly comprehensive hearing to the first counsel. After that I think the others can pick 
up whatever threads remain to be argued because if we start giving the same amount to second, 
third, then we'll never... there will be no end to it. So once the ground has been covered by the 
counsel who has argued first then after that of the second counsel, then for the others, I think...  
Fair enough. 
So....  
We always adhere to that... 
Mr. Sibal can we suggest, can we suggest that 
you can continue until lunch tomorrow because we are starting right up in the morning?  
We will take My Lords, a little more than that because we have to go through 
the history because this has to be dealt within a historical context.  
 
Alright.  
My Lords, let me put it this way, I will try and do it, My Lords. And if Your 
Lordships feel that I need a little more time Your Lordships <UNCLEAR> 
Absolutely, we are not going to... if you feel that, 
you know.... Because our conscience also has to be satisfied that we have heard that side of the 
matter fully from you.  
Mr. Sibal, in that request, because we have spent hours, 
I mean thousands  pages of [UNCLEAR] 
That's alright. But we don't have to read all the 
documents. I mean that's why, written submissions are filed. So Mr... 
Lot of it is historical documents. 
That's right. 
That's right. But that history is important, which is 
very... 
I agree some part of the history is important. But I 
don't think we get mired in history only.  
Not at all. 
Of course. <UNCLEAR> legal proposition to be 
decided.  
The three of  Your Lordships have heard this matter 
once before. When we started it took... 
So Mr. Subramaniam and Mr. Shekhar Naphade 
have, you know, I shouldn't say billed for 8 hours but at least said that they are going to take 
hours. So I think the 8 hours and 10 hours from Mr. Subramaniam, I think that's a little bit 
 
of an overstatement. I think we'll have to cut down that. And Mr. Naphade we will also have 
to request you to cut down your submissions. So last time... 
Your Lordships, can you give one and half hours to two hours? 
[UNCLEAR] 
So let's...we will start by... 
Last time... let me say this... 
Or else Mr. Ramachandran [UNCLEAR] because he has argued in the 
past.  
He argued. He's not now. He's not addressing because 
the party for whom he's appearing has withdrawn. But the point is on the last hearing almost 
90% was, at least three of us are party to the hearing. And I think in about four days or so four 
to five days we had almost finished the hearing of the petition. 
The question of the reference on those two judgements, 
that's all.  
The difficulty was when the preliminary issue was framed 
whether 1960 or... 
Most parties, I am sorry, most parties argued the 
merits of the matter.   
Your Lordship, you are right, Mr. Ramachandran and 
Mr. Zafar Shah [UNCLEAR] 
They had argued the full length I remember. I had 
made notes of that time... 
[UNCLEAR] Your Lordships may recall initially. We had argued actually 
the law point whether there is an overlapping in the sense that the judgment which has been 
given [UNCLEAR]. 
 
You are right. Let's do this. Let's get down now.... 
Four distinguished judges have not heard that.  
Two people [UNCLEAR]. Two people have fully 
argued it, I remember it distinctly.  
Let Mr. Sibal open. And I am sure by the end of 
the day we will have a good picture.  
My Lords, myself, I will not take more than 2 hours. Whenever Your 
Lordships give, whatever the order.  
My Lords, I'll take a little more than that. My friend may take 2 hours 
but I'll take more than that.  
That Mr. Zafar should... 
Your Lordship.  
Mr. Dhavan praising Mr. Zafar Shah in the last 
proceeding that he had set [UNCLEAR]. 
What had happened on the last occasion was that two counsel had 
addressed my Lords - Mr. Ramachandran and Mr. Zafar Shah. After that, my Lords had only 
heard us on the question of reference to a larger Bench. 
You are right. Absolutely right. Two of them. Zafar... 
I addressed Your Lordships only on the reference.  
You are right. Only Raju Ramachandran and Zafar 
Shah fully argued the matter. 
That's right.  
 
Your Lordship, may I submit? Permit me to submit my submission please. I 
want to say something to the Honourable Court please Your Lordship.  
This is an application to Your Lordships not in the matter My 
Lords. I am really sorry to do this but clarification is needed whether My Lords Court 3, My 
Lord Honourable Justice Bose's Bench can hear mentioning. There is something very urgent 
that... 
There is a provision in the latest SOP. 
Your Lordships are... I am just.... 
There is a provision in the SOP, circulate an 
email. I've said that however I urgent something is, once the mentioning is not available or the 
mentioning is over, just an email will be put up to me by the registrar listing. I'll pass orders 
immediately. So just read the SOP. It has everything in that.  
Because Your Lordships have Constitution Bench...  
I think yesterday, every mentioning request 
which was made until late night yesterday was attended to. I was in fact a little more liberal 
because I knew that this was going to happen, that we are the first five are going to be in a 
Constitution Bench. All requests have been granted. If there's something over and above that, 
the SOP has a provision even for that. Follow the SOP, I'll give you a date immediately.  
We will send that email immediately. There is something very 
dire My Lords.  
Yes. So Mr. Sibal we'll start.  
Your Lordship.... 
Yes, Mr. Sharma? 
Your Lordship, am I clear? May I request Your Lordships? 
 
You are very clear Mr. Sharma. What do you want to 
say? 
Your Lordships.... 
Mr. Sharma, I can anticipate what you are saying. 
Yeah. I want to say.... 
We are not calling this matter by the name of any 
Article 370, I think that should resolve your problem. 
I agree. My request is only that of course, I filed the first petition. I have a 
very serious issue with me. Permit me to argue in the last. I'm not saying allow me first. Permit 
me to argue in the last...  
Of course Mr. Sharma. Yes. Mr. Attorney, 
likewise I think we don't have to... we will also request your side also to not overlap and then... 
We will not overlap anything. I will not touch the point, whatever are going 
to be submitted by anyone over here. I have total different thing... 
Yes, yes Mr. Sharma, we got your point now.  
You will be the last batsman. Yes. 
Yeah, but give me.... 
Necessarily be based upon what is argued, what points are formulated, 
how etc. And before they end, we would not indicate our time. We have understood My Lord, 
the concern that there should not be any repetition, unwarranted repetition etc. 
May I please My Lord... 
A point of clarification Your Lordship. I was appointed the nodal counsel, 
unfortunately not able to present as I am down with conjunctivitis. But Writ Petition (Civil) 
no. 1099 of 2019, in which Mr. Ramachandran was appearing, although two parties have 
 
withdrawn, there are other petitioners who are still prosecuting this case and there will be 
representation for that as well.  
Alright. Who will be appearing in that, for the 
remaining petitioners Mr. Prasanna? 
We are still hoping that Mr Ramachandran can come [UNCLEAR]. 
Let us know as.... 
Difficulty that... 
With regard to main petitioners it's clear, with regards to 
interveners Your Lordship nodal officer has given us time. 
We'll see about the interveners. Let's first hear 
the counsel, and then we'll see what remains. 
[UNCLEAR] described by Mr. Prasanna, the Nodal Officer. 
But the Court is to decide. 
He has suggested the time frame. We will then... 
we will see. Of course, we will not.... we'll certainly decide at the end of the... once we have a 
few of the leading counsel who make their submissions, we will know what areas still remain. 
We will assign some time. Yes Mr. Sibal. 
Mr. Sibal would be arguing which petition? So that we can have that.  
That is In Re: 370 now. 
No. Whom do you represent? That's all. So that we can say that the 
pleadings from...  
Mr. Lone.  
Lone? 
 
Yeah. Akbar Lone My Lord. 
Yes.  
This is indeed , according to me, a historic moment in many ways. First, My 
Lord that Your Lordships would be analysing why history was tossed out on the 6th of August 
2019. Whether the procedure adopted by Parliament was consistent with what democracy 
stands for. Whether the will of the people of Jammu and Kashmir could be silenced in this 
fashion. Whether they will be denied a representative form of government through a dictate of 
the Union inconsistent with our Constitution. It is also historic because it has taken five years 
for Your Lordships to start hearing this case and for five years, My Lords, there has been no 
representative government in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is also historic because you 
will have to interpret Article 356 of the Constitution of India, an Article which seeks to restore 
democracy. And how did that process, through an article which sought to restore democracy 
you have decimated democracy. Can that be done under Article 356? That the State of Jammu 
and Kashmir, historically represented a very unique relationship unlike princely states and the 
states of India, which were integrated into the Union. Whether that historic relationship 
between sovereign authorities could have been jettisoned in this fashion by seeking to amend 
the Constitution and seeking to efface Article 370. Whether My Lords, a Governor of a state 
would have on the 20th June 2018 decided that I will keep the Assembly under suspended 
animation, which is the power of the Governor alone on the J&K Constitution, without even 
trying to find out whether they can form a Government or not. Because on the 19th June, a 
particular party withdrew support and on the 20th of June, the Governor passed this order. 
Whether on the 21st November 2018 a dissolution of the Assembly could have taken place 
before the imposition of Article 356. The Governor on the 21st of June dissolved the Assembly 
without reference to 356. And thereafter, Article 356 was used and the manner that it was used 
will be My Lords...I will address Your Lordships on those issues. These are  issues that will 
arise for Your Lordships consideration, never raised, never decided by this court. So in that 
sense too, it is historic. So My Lords I will proceed because there is a historical context to the 
state of Jammu and Kashmir. So I'll have to take Your Lordships through that history. And if 
Your Lordships will permit me My Lords, I'll start with a list of dates. 
Mr. Sibal, as all counsel know that all the 
arguments we have the benefit now of live transcription. So the arguments are being 
simultaneously, we have transcripts in the court on the basis of speech to text software. Like 
in the Maharashtra case, by the end of the day the transcripts will be given to the arguing 
 
counsels. Your juniors can just verify that there are no mistakes. If there are any corrections, 
they can be given to the registry so that we will upload them immediately on our website, so 
they are available for everybody then to... that will also help counsel who are following. 
Absolutely. 
Of course it helps us as well, as well as everybody 
else. 
So My Lords, I'll start off with the list of dates which is Volume 2, Written 
Submissions, Volume 2, PDF page 33. My Lords, Written Submissions, Volume 2, PDF Page 
33. We were reluctant students but Your Lordships ensured that we become disciplined 
students. Yes, the list of dates because it's somewhat elaborated, because it'll give you a flavour 
what the issues are My Lords. May I My Lords? 33 My Lords, PDF page 33. It's called Appendix 
1, list of dates and events. 
5th of March, 1846.  
That's correct. That's correct. Hope it is 33 My Lords.  
It is 33.  
Okay, fine. 
May I, My Lords? Before this, may I just state one... I want to make one 
statement clear, that we stand here on the premise that the integration of Jammu and Kashmir 
into India is unquestionable, was unquestionable and always remained unquestionable. That 
was a given. And despite that My Lords, the whole structure was overnight, My Lords changed 
through a process which I will demonstrate was unconstitutional. When Your Lordships will 
be dealing with this matter, there will be four legislations, in a sense that you'll be dealing with. 
One is the Constitution of India, the second is the Constitution of India as applicable in the 
State of Jammu and Kashmir, third is the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and fourth is 
Article 370. And the interaction between these three Constitutions in the context of Article 370 
is something that Your Lordships will have to look at as we move forward. But please keep that 
in mind. The reason why I say Constitution of India is applicable to the State of Jammu and 
Kashmir, that over time My Lords, there were several orders issued, constitutional orders from 
time to time, which were incorporated in the Constitution of India as applicable to Jammu and 
 
Kashmir. The result was that most of the powers that... most of the responsibilities and powers 
were actually in tandem with the Constitution of India. There was, in fact, really no difference 
other than Article 370 itself. All the laws were applicable except that those laws were replicated 
in the Constitutional orders of the Government of India. So, therefore there was no reason to 
take away this right. It's in that context My Lords that I'm mentioning this. Now My Lords I'll 
go to the list of dates.  
On the 9 March 1846, the Treaty of Lahore was executed between Maharaja of Lahore, and the 
British Government, resulting in the transfer of certain territories to the East India Company. 
In particular, under Article 4 of the Treaty, the Maharaja cedes to the honourable Company, 
all its forts, territories, rights and interests in the hill countries, which are situated between 
the River Beas and Indus, including provinces of Cashmere and Hazara. Earlier, Jammu's 
Maharaja Gulab Singh's General, Zorawar Singh had invaded Ladakh in 1834. Ladakh came 
under Dogra rule and was incorporated into the state of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846. During 
the Sino Sikh War the Qing Empire invaded Ladakh for the Sino Tibetan Army was defeated. 
Ladakh was claimed as a part of Tibet by Phuntsok Wangyal, a Tibetan Communist leader. In 
partition left Ladakh a part of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir to be administered 
from Srinagar. On the 16th of March 1846, following the Treaty of Lahore, the British 
Government executed the Treaty of Amritsar on March 16, 1846. Under the Treaty, the hilly, 
mountainous country with its dependencies situated in the east of River Indus and west of 
River Ravi , including Chamba and excluding Lahore, Lahore was transferred by the British 
Government to Maharaja Gulab Singh of Jammu. The reason was simple My Lords. There was 
a violation of the Treaty of Lahore, and therefore compensation had to be paid My Lords to 
the British government. He was not able to pay that compensation. In lieu of that 
compensation, these territories were ceded. That's what happened. On the 30th of June 1857, 
Gulab Singh died and was succeeded by his son, Ranbir Singh. Following the passage of the 
Government of India Act 1858, territories formerly in possession under control of the East 
India Company were vested in the British monarch in whose name India was to be governed. 
1885, Maharaja Ranbir Singh died and was succeeded by Maharaja Pratap Singh. In 1889, 
30th of August, the Interpretation Act of 1889 was passed by the UK Parliament, Section 18(4) 
of the act defined the expression British India. All territories and places within Her Majesty's 
dominion, which after the time being governed by Her Majesty through the Governor General 
of India. In addition, the term India was defined under Section 18(5), as British India, together 
with any territories of any native Prince or Chief under the suzerainty of Her Majesty exercised 
to the Governor General of India. You will note here My Lords, Jammu and Kashmir is not 
part of this. In 1925, Maharaja Patap Singh was succeeded by Maharaja Hari Singh, the last 
ruler of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. And on the 20th of April, 1927 the 
 
expression State Subject was defined in the State Subject Definition Notification dated April 
1927, which was issued by Maharaja Hari Singh. This notification classified State Subjects 
into four classes and subsequently became the basis for the definition of permanent residents 
of Jammu and Kashmir under the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir in Article 35(a) of the 
Constitution of India.' Your Lordship need not go into it because we are not really dealing with 
that issue. But I am just mentioning it. 'On the  22nd of April 1934, Maharaja Hari Singh 
enacted Regulation 1 of Samvat 1991 on April 22, 1934.' Wherever there is Samvat My Lord, if 
you take away 57 years that gives you the year. 'The regulation established a Legislative 
Assembly for the State of Jammu and Kashmir called the Praja Sabha. While certain legislative 
functions were delegated to the Praja Sabha, the ruler, Maharaja Hari Singh retained 
supremacy over all legislative, executive, and judicial matters. On the 2nd of August 1935, the 
Government of India Act 1935 was passed by the UK Parliament. The Act established India as 
a Federation comprising Governors' Provinces, Chief Commissioners' Provinces, the Indian 
States, which had or would accede to the Federation of India.  
Under Section 6 of the said Act, the ruler of Indian Princely States was empowered to execute 
an Instrument of accession, declaring that he accedes to the Federation of India, subject to the 
terms of such instrument. Under Section 2, an Instrument of accession was to specify matters 
with respect to which the Federal Legislature would have competence to legislate for a 
particular state and the limitations, if any, on the Federal Legislature's power to make laws or 
exercise executive authority over such state. Notably as the state of Jammu and Kashmir was 
not a part of British India, provisions of the Government of India Act 1935 did not apply to it 
unless an Instrument of accession was executed by its ruler in accordance with Section 6. On 
the 7th of September 1939, the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution Act 1939 was promulgated. 
While Maharaja Hari Singh retained sovereignty and supremacy over all legislative, executive, 
and judicial functions, the act provided the Praja Sabha to make laws for the entire state of 
Jammu and Kashmir or any part thereof, subject to certain conditions. Further, the said act, 
vested executive functions with counsel consisting of a Prime Minister and other ministers 
appointed by the ruler. The Act also provided for the High Court, which had been established 
by the ruler in 1928 to be a court of record with jurisdiction to adjudicate upon inter alia civil 
suits, civil criminal and revenue suits. On the 16th May 1946, the Cabinet Mission issued a 
statement regarding its report. Under paragraph 15(1) and (4) of that statement, the Cabinet 
Mission Plan envisaged a Union of India, where the Union would have responsibility over 
Defence, Foreign Affairs and Communications, and the states would retain jurisdiction over 
all other subjects not ceded to the Union. On the 12th, 22nd May 1946, the Cabinet Mission 
issued a memorandum titled 'States, Treaties and Paramountcy', which affirmed that 
following the establishment of an independent Government in India, the paramountcy of the 
 
British monarch over Indian States would lapse and paramountcy power over their respective 
territories would return to the states. On the 19th of December 1946, the Constituent Assembly 
of India, in terms of the Cabinet Mission Plan, met for the first session. On the 22nd of January 
1947, the Constituent Assembly of India unanimously adopted the Objectives Resolution, 
which declared the Assembly's firm and solemn resolve to proclaim India as an independent 
sovereign Republic. Importantly, paragraph 3 of the Objective Resolution declared that 
princely states that had joined the Union of India, and I quote, whether with their present 
boundaries or with such others as maybe determined by the Constituent Assembly and 
thereafter, according to the law of the Constitution, shall possess and retain the status of 
Autonomous Units, together with residuary powers and exercise all powers and functions of 
Government and administration, save and accept such powers and functions as are vested in 
or assigned in the Union.  
On the 25 January 1947, the Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution- the establishment of 
the Union Powers Committee to inter alia draw up lists of matters included in the and 
interconnected with the suffix assigned to the Union, before the framing of the Constitution. 
On the 5 July 1947, the Union Powers Committee submitted its second report of the 
Constituent Assembly. Significantly, the report noted in paragraph 3 and I quote, "It is 
necessary to indicate the position of Indian States as a scheme proposed by us. The States 
which have joined the Constituent Assembly have done so on the basis of the 16th May 
statement. Some of them have expressed themselves as willing to cede wider powers to the 
Centres than contemplated in that statement. But we consider it necessary to point out that 
the application to states in general of the federal list of subjects, insofar as it goes beyond the 
16th May statement, should be with their consent. It follows from this, that in their case, 
residuary powers would vest with them unless their consent to their vesting in the centre. And 
Your Lordship knows that consent was given.  
The UK Parliament on 18th of July 1947, passed the Indian Independence Act of 1947 under 
(1)(1) Sec(1)(1) of the Act. From August 15, 1947, two independent dominions, India and 
Pakistan, were to be established. Significantly, Section 7(1)(b) of the Act stated that following 
independence, the suzerainty of the British monarch over Indian states would lapse and 
returned to the rulers of such states. Resultantly as sovereign states, as many as 562 princely 
states had the choice to remain independent or accede to either of the two dominions 
established by the Act. Lastly, as a transitional measure, Section 8 prescribed that provisions 
of the Government of India Act 1935, would continue to apply to the dominion of India and 
Pakistan, subject to certain conditions. Under Section 9 of the Indian Independence Act, the 
Governor General issued the India Provisional Constitutional Order 1947, which made certain 
 
sections of the Government of India Act 1935 applicable to India until other provisions were 
made by the Constituent Assembly. Among the applicable provisions was Section 6, which 
dealt with accession of princely states to India through the execution of the Instrument of 
Accession. On the 15th August, India attained independence and it was partitioned into the 
dominions of India and Pakistan. Further, as British paramountcy had lapsed, princely states 
that had not executed instruments of accession with either dominion became independent 
states. These included the states of Junagadh, Hyderabad, and Jammu and Kashmir.  
On 26th of October 1947, the ruler of Jammu and Kashmir made an offer of accession to India 
asking for help from the Indian dominion to meet a grave emergency caused by mass 
infiltration of tribesmen wronged from distant area of Northwest Frontier coming regularly in 
motor trucks, Mansehra-Muzaffarabad Road, and fully armed with up to date weapons, which 
cannot possibly be done without the knowing of the provincial Government of the Northwest 
Frontier Province and the Government of Pakistan. In the Instrument of Accession signed by 
him on the same date he declared his accession to India subject to the terms of such 
instrument. Under Section 3 of the instrument, the dominion legislature had authority to 
make laws for the State of Jammu and Kashmir on the subjects of Defence, External Affairs, 
and Communication. Article 7, provided that the Instrument of Accession did not commit the 
ruler to the acceptance of any future Constitution of India, while Section 8, vested sovereignty 
over subjects not acceded to India in the ruler."  
My Lords, just two issues, I want to flag here. Your Lordships, in the course of this hearing will 
have to determine what does the Constituent Assembly stand for. A Constituent Assembly 
stands for enacting a Constitution for the future of the territories with respect to which the 
Constitution is to apply. It's essentially a political exercise. It's not a legal exercise. It's a 
political exercise to take into account the aspirations of people, what kind of state the people 
want and in the context of that draft the Constitution. Right? 
The constitution itself is a political document, but it takes into account the aspirations of 
several segments of society living within a united territory. Takes into account their separate 
aspirations and in the context of that drafts a constitution to meet the aspirations in future 
years for decades to come. So the exercise of a Constituent Assembly is a political exercise. The 
drafting of the constitution, which is a political document, is a political exercise. Once the 
constitution is drafted, once it is come into place, then all institutions under the constitution 
are governed by the constitution. And those institutions are limited, are limited in the exercise 
of their powers because they have to exercise their powers consistent with the provisions of 
the constitution. Parliament cannot convert itself into a Constituent Assembly. That's done. 
 
Today the Indian Parliament can't say by a resolution that we are the Constituent Assembly. 
As a matter of law, they can't say it. Because they are now cabined, cribbed and confined by 
the provisions of the constitution. They can't pass a law which is outside the list. They can pass 
a law under 254. If the state passes a law, it's repugnant. They must adhere the basic features 
of the constitution. They can't suspend, except in emergencies with external aggression, the 
fundamental rights of people. That also is limited under the provisions of the Constitution. 
The executive can't do things which are contrary to the law and the judiciary then declares the 
law. But no Parliament can convert itself into a Constituent Assembly. And if you accept that 
proposition of law, it has enormous consequences for the future of my country. And that is one 
of the most salient and according to me, the core issues to be decided in this case. Because 
Parliament converted said that we declare the legislature of the State of Jammu and Kashmir 
as a Constituent Assembly. Where does Parliament get that power? How does Parliament get 
that power? Under which provision of law? Not under 356.  
So that's My Lords, according to me, the core of the issue that Your Lordship will have to 
decide. May I now, My Lords, with Your Lordships permission, read the Instrument of 
Accession? Because what happened on the 26th of October actually the invasion so to say was 
started on the 20th of October and within six days, these decisions were taken. Because the 
invaders came, they were armed, they had guns. They would have run over the state. The ruler 
realizes that he cannot secure the security of his own people. He had entered into a standstill 
agreement with Pakistan. India refused to enter into a standstill agreement with him and then 
My Lords thereafter what happened? Thereafter what happened was that he said, "Look, I 
need help." And he told Mountbatten I cannot possibly secure my people. So thereafter, the 
proceedings started. He sought. And he said, "Look, if you help me, I will unconditionally 
access to India subject to my own conditions", which is separate My Lords, from the 
Instrument of Accession of the other states. And India accepted it, and that's how India 
secured the pace and was able to, My Lords.... And of course, the precursor to that is the 
Radcliffe Award, in terms of which the part of Gurdaspur would connected Jammu & Kashmir, 
My Lords, to India, was ceded to India under the Radcliffe Award, which allowed for that 
contiguity, which was the basic principle on the basis of which the partition was to take place. 
So that's how all this happened. Now let me read to Your Lordships, the Instrument of 
Accession. Volume 1 My Lords. Documents, Volume 1.  
My Lords, kindly come to PDF page... yes. PDF page 7, Offer of Accession by Maharaja Hari 
Singh on 26th of October 1947. Documents, Volume 1, PDF page 7. Yes, My Lords. Volume 1 
My Lords page 7. PDF page is also 7.   Page 7 yes.

Yes. Offer of Accession by Maharaja Hari Singh. 
We begin with page 7? 
Yes. Page 7 My Lords. 26th October 1947.  
Mr. Sibal, you are referring Documents, Volume 1. 
Yes, Volume 1.  
Treaty of... 
Yes. My Lord. Lord Mountbatten wrote that letter.  
'I have to inform' - may I My Lords? 'I have to inform Your Excellency that a grave emergency 
has risen in my state and request immediate assistance of your Government. As Your 
Excellency is aware the State of Jammu and Kashmir has not acceded to the Dominion of India 
or to Pakistan. Geographically, my state is contiguous to both the Dominions. It has vital ... It 
has vital economic and cultural links with both of them. Besides my state has a common 
boundary with the Soviet Republic of China. This should be 'and China', it should be sorry 'and 
China'. In their external relations and Dominion of India and Pakistan cannot ignore this fact. 
I wanted to take time to decide to which Dominion I should accede,' - Basically My Lords, he 
wanted to be independent, quite frankly. But given this situation, he had no choice. - 'or 
whether it is not in the best interest of both the Dominions and my State to stand independent, 
of course, with friendly and cordial relations with both. I accordingly approach the Dominions 
of India and Pakistan and entered into a standstill agreement with my State. Pakistan 
Government accepted this agreement. The Dominion of India desired further discussions with 
representatives of my Government. I could not arrange this in view of the developments 
indicated below. In fact, the Pakistan Government are operating Post and Telegraph system 
inside the state. Though we have got a standstill agreement with the Pakistan Government  
permitted steady and increasing strangulation of supplies like food, salt and petrol in my 
state... to my state. Afridis, soldiers in plain clothes and desperadoes with modern weapons 
have been allowed to infilter into the state at first in Poonch and then in Sialkot.' - There was 
a Poonch revolt, My Lords, - 'and finally in mass area adjoining Hazara District, on the Ramkot 
side. The result has been that the limited number of troops at the disposal of the state had to 
be dispersed and thus had to  face the enemy at several points simultaneously. That it has 
 
become difficult to stop the wanton discussion of life and property and looting. The Mahora 
Power House, which supplies electric current to the whole of Srinagar, has been burnt. The 
number of women who have been kidnapped and raped makes my heart bleed. The wild forces 
thus let loose on the state are marching on with the aim of capturing Srinagar, the summer 
capital of my Government as a first step to overrunning the whole state. The mass infiltration 
tribesmen drawn from the distant areas of Northwest Frontier, coming regularly in motor 
trucks using Mansehra-Muzaffarabad Road and fully armed with up to date weapons, cannot 
possibly be done without the knowing of the provincial Government of the NWSP and the 
Government of Pakistan. In spite of repeated requests made by my Government, no attempt 
has been made to check these raiders or stop them from coming to my state. The Pakistan 
radio even put out a story that a provincial government has been set up in Kashmir. The people 
of my state, both Muslims generally, both the Muslims generally have taken no part at all. With 
the conditions obtaining at present in my state and to the great emergency of the situation as 
it exists, I say no option, I have it should be, I have no option but to ask for help from the 
Indian dominion. Naturally, they cannot send the help asked for by me, without my state 
acceding to the dominion of India. I have accordingly decided to do so and I attach the 
instrument of accession for acceptance by your Government. The other alternative is to leave 
my state and my people to freebooters. On this basis, no civilized Government can exist or be 
maintained. The alternative I will never allow to happen as long as I am ruler of the State and 
I have life to defend my country. I may also inform Your Excellency's Government that it is my 
intention to once to set up an interim government and ask Sheikh Abdullah to carry the 
responsibilities in this emergency with my Prime Minister. If my state has to be saved, 
immediate assistance must be available at Srinagar. Mr. Menon is fully aware of the situation 
and he will explain to you if further explanation is needed. In haste and with kindest regards.'  
My Lords, Your Lordship may, just a historical fact, at that point in time, Sheikh Abdullah was 
in prison and he had been always against the ruler because he wanted the will of the people of 
Jammu and Kashmir, My Lords and not a despotic ruler. So he was against the Sadr-e-Riyasat, 
so to say. But My Lords, when he realized that look, unless I get him on my side. I'm not going 
to be able to defend. So he My Lords, released him, and said, you form the interim 
Government. Just a historical fact. That's how it happened. Yeah, I know that. But I want to 
bring politics into it. The moment I take somebody's name, they'll be the other side, no, no, 
no. Nehru had nothing to do with this. So I don't want to enter into politics here. No politics 
My Lord. I don't want fireworks in a very solemn occasion like this.           
So, My Lords, now the Instrument of Accession, page 9. Actually Your Lordships knows more 
than we do. Your Lordship knows more about it than we do.  
 
No, no, we always keep learning. 
My learned colleague points out there are very interesting snippets in the 
transfer of our documents as to how this happened, and VP Menon actually sets it up.  
I just told them there was 7 miles from the Srinagar, 
the raiders. So then the Army was asked to... 
Absolutely, absolutely. Electricity My Lords was... and they could not be 
controlled as they were raiders. There was no choice. I mean he never wanted to accede but 
there was no choice. So may I My Lords? Page 9. Whereas the Indian Independence Act, 1947 
provides that as... it’s obvious My Lords, 15th August was independence. He did not 
immediately accede. All the other Maharajas acceded apart from those two, Junagadh and 
Hyderabad. He never wanted to. It's only in October that this happened. Whereas the Indian 
Independence Act 1947 provides that as from the 15th day of August 1947, there shall be set 
up an independent dominion known as India, and that the Government of India Act 1935 shall, 
with such omissions, additions, adaptations and modifications of the Governor General may 
by order specify, be applicable to the dominion of India. And whereas, the Government of 
India Act 1935 as so adopted by the Governor General provides, that an Indian state may 
accede to the Dominion of India by an instrument of accession executed by the ruler 
[UNCLEAR]. 
Now, therefore, "I Shriman Inder Mahendra Rajrajeshwar Maharajadhiraj Shri Hari Singh ji, 
Jammu and Kashmir Naresh Tatha Tibbetadi Deshadhipati ruler of Jammu and Kashmir state 
in the exercise of my sovereignty in and over my said state do hereby execute this instrument. 
I hereby declare that I accede to the Dominion of India with the intent the Governor General 
of India, the dominion Legislature, the Federal Court, and any other dominion authority 
established for the purposes of the dominion, shall by virtue of this my Instrument of 
Accession, but subject always to the terms thereof.... kindly mark that... subject always to the 
terms thereof, and for the purposes only of the dominion, exercise in relation to the State of 
Jammu and Kashmir such functions as may be vested in them by or under the Government of 
India Act 1935, as in force in the dominion of India on the 15th day of August, 1947. Such 
functions there may be vested. I hereby assume the obligation of ensuring that due effect is 
given to the provisions of the Act within the state so far as they are applicable therein, by virtue 
of my Instrument of Accession. I accept the matter specified in the Schedule hereto, as the 
matter with respect to which the dominion legislature may make law for the state. I hereby 
declare that I accede to the Dominion of India on the assurance that if an agreement is made 
 
between the Governor General and the ruler of the state, whereby any functions in relation to 
the administration of the state of any law of the dominion legislature shall be exercised by the 
ruler of the state, that any such agreement shall be construed and have effect accordingly. In 
terms of this Instrument of Accession, my Instrument of Accession shall not be varied by any 
amendment of the Act or the Indian Independence Act, 1947 unless such amendment is 
accepted by the... by instrument supplementary to this Instrument. Nothing in this instrument 
shall empower the dominion legislature, to make any law for this  
sub... This state authorizing the compulsory acquisition of land for any purpose. But I hereby 
undertake that should the dominion for the purpose of a dominion law which applies in the 
state deem it necessary to acquire any land, I will at their request, acquire the land at their 
expense. Or if the land belongs to me, transfer it to them on such terms as maybe agreed or in 
default of agreement determined by an arbitrator to be appointed by The Chief Justice of India. 
Nothing in this instrument shall be deemed to commit in any way to my acceptance, of any 
future Constitution of India, or to fetter my discretion to enter into an agreement with the 
Government of India under any such future constitution. Nothing as an instrument affects the 
continuance of my sovereignty, in and over this state, or save as provided by or under this 
instrument, the exercise of any powers, authority, and rights now enjoyed by me as a ruler of 
this state, or the validity of any law at present in force in this State. I hereby declare, and I 
execute this Instrument on behalf of the state, and that any reference to this Instrument to me 
or to the ruler of the state is to be construed as including reference to my heirs and successors." 
And the acceptance Your Lordship will find at 11. 
"I hereby accept this Instrument of Accession dated this 20th day of October.... 27th day of 
October, 1947." Now My Lords.... sorry.  
My Lords. Now there is a schedule to this accession, which is not in this document. But would 
My Lords be kind enough to turn to Document Volume 4, PDF page 176? That has the 
schedule.  
Volume 4 page? 
Page 176. Running page 738, PDF page 176. Volume 4.   
Running page 738? 
738. Yes 738. Yes. That's correct, that's correct. Your Lordships might just 
remember the residuary power unlike states in India, which vested under 97 with the Union 
 
vested in the state. Residuary power did not vest in the Union, in the relationship of J&K with 
the Union. So it was quintessentially, a truly federal marriage, so to say. 
Actually the resolution when it was passed by the 
Constituent Assembly, initially contemplated that the residuary power would be with the 
states. And it was between the time that the resolution and the eventual adoption of the 
Constitution that the residuary power, eventually 97 came to the centre. 
But they all accepted it. But here this issue was somewhat different. Now in 
the schedule will... 
Now My Lords kindly see... Now My Lords kindly see the Schedule. 'Defence - Naval, Military 
and Air Forces of the Dominion and any other armed force raised or maintained by the 
Dominion; any armed forces, including forces raised or maintained by an acceding state, 
which are attached to, or operating with, any of the armed forces of the Dominion. Naval, 
Military and Air Force works, administration of cantonment areas, arms, fire-arms, 
ammunition, explosives.' 
Then, 'External Affairs - like the implementing of treaties, agreements with other countries; 
extradition, including the surrender of criminals and accused persons to parts of His Majesty's 
Dominions outside India. Admission into, and emigration and expulsion from, India, 
including in relation thereto the regulation of the movements in India of persons who are 
British subjects, domiciled in India or subjects of any acceding state; pilgrimages to places 
beyond India. Naturalisation.' 
Then, 'Communications - Post and telegraphs, including telephones, wireless, broadcasting 
and other forms and railways, etc.' We need not go into this. Maritime shipping, navigation, 
port quarantine, major ports and then My Lords, aircraft, lighthouses, carriage of passengers. 
And then My Lords, 'Ancillary - Election to the Dominion Legislature subject to the provisions 
of the Act, and of any order made thereunder. Offences against laws with respect to any of the 
aforesaid matters. Inquiries and statistics for the purposes of any of the aforesaid matters. The 
jurisdiction and powers of all courts with respect to any of the aforesaid matters but, except 
with the consent of the Ruler of the acceding state, not so as to confer any jurisdiction or 
powers upon any courts other than courts ordinarily exercising in or in relation to the state.' 
Right? So that's what .... 
These subjects, do they correspond specifically 
to certain entries on the Government of India Act? 
 
No, My Lord, the subjects of the State were with reference to those residing 
in the state, those who had come to the state, those who were in Pakistan, and came back. So 
that's a 1927 order which I'll point to Your Lordship later.  
Possibly these subjects which the instrument of 
accession... 
Yes. 
...recognizes, in terms of the legislative powers 
of the dominion... 
Yes. 
...must cover certain specific entries in the 
Government of India Act. So these subjects are, for instance, defence- 1 2 3 4 
Yes, we will cover the entries. 
There would be certain specific entries in the 
Government of India Act with reference to which there was an acceptance. 
Correct, My Lords, I will find that out and tell Your Lordships about which 
part of the Government of India Act covers these. I appreciate that. 
Then My Lords, kindly come back, come back to Volume 1. Yes then come to My Lords, 'Reply 
from Lord Mountbatten to Maharaja Hari Singh'. That's at page 12. 
Page? 
Page 12 My Lords. "My dear Maharaja Sahib, Your Highness' letter dated 26 
October has been delivered to me by VP Menon. In the special circumstances mentioned by 
Your Highness, my government had decided to accept the accession of Kashmir State to the 
Dominion of India. Consistently with their policy that in the case of any state where the issue 
of accession has been the subject of dispute, the question of accession should be decided in 
accordance with the wishes of the people of the state. It is my Government's wish that as soon 
as law and order has been restored in Kashmir, in a soil declared cleared of the invader, the 
question of the state's accession should be settled by reference to the people. Meanwhile, in 
 
response to Your Highness' appeal for military aid, action has been taken today to send troops 
of the Indian Army to Kashmir to help your own forces, to defend your territory and to protect 
the lives, property and honour of your people. My Government and I note with satisfaction 
that Your Highness has decided to invite Sheikh Abdullah to form an interim Government to 
work with you, with your Prime Minister. Then we go back to the list of....[UNCLEAR] page 
38. 
38. 
And My Lord, I've already read to Your Lordships, My Lord, the acceptance 
letter of Mountbatten. So we go to 23, 5th of March 1948. 
You want to go back to the list of dates? 
Yes, My Lords, go back to the list of dates. PDF38, Volume 1.  
What page are you reading, Mr. Sibal? 
5th of March My Lord, that entry. Because I've already read 22nd of October 
letter of Lord Mountbatten. On the 5th of March... My Lord has that? Volume 1, PDF page 38. 
My Lord, 5th of March 1948. 
5th of March 1948. 
Item 23. The ruler.... Your Lordship has that? The ruler, Maharaja... 
One minute please. 
I'm sorry. 
Volume 2. 
Volume one My Lords. 
Same place where I was reading. Some cases it's Volume 2, 
in some cases it's... 
 
Yeah, Written Submissions Compilation, Volume 2. That's correct. Yes, yes. 
WS Volume 2. 
PDF? 
PDF 38, WS Volume 2. 5th of March 1948, the ruler, Maharaja Hari Singh 
issued a proclamation under which a popular interim government was established in the state 
of Jammu and Kashmir, pending the framing of Constitution for the state, proclamation inter 
alia. My Lords, it's better if we read the whole proclamation. This is at Volume 6, PDF, page 
242. That's Volume 6, PDF page 2... sorry 242.   
Volume 6?  
It says My Lords, if Your Lordship has it? My Lord, Justice Surya Kant has 
it? 
Volume 2? 
242, My Lords. Volume 6, PDF page 242. Running page is 1291. As Maharaja 
on the 5th of March 1948... that's the one. Running page 1291. That's correct. That's correct. 
Well, we have to show PDF My Lords, otherwise it becomes difficult. 
Yes. 
In accordance with the tradition, My Lords, all of them correspond to the 
provisions of the Government of India Act. They were more there, but they were whittled 
down, that's all. But they do correspond. Just wanted to answer Your Lordships. 'In 
accordance with the traditions of my dynasty, I have from time to time provided for increasing 
association of my people with the administration of the State with the object of realizing the 
goal of full responsible Government at as early a date as possible and in pursuance of that 
object, have by the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution Act 1996, established a Constitutional 
Government with the Council of Ministers, the Legislature with the majority,'- That's the Praja 
Sabha - 'with the majority of elected members and an independent Judiciary. I've noted with 
gratification and pride the progress so far made and the legitimate desire of my people for the 
immediate establishment of a fully Democratic Constitution based on adult franchise with a 
hereditary Ruler from my dynasty as the Constitutional Head of an Executive responsible to 
the legislature. I've already appointed the popular leader of my people, Sheikh Mohammad 
 
Abdullah, as the Head of the emergency administration. It is now my desire to replace the 
emergency administration by a popular Interim Government and to provide for its powers, 
duties, and functions, pending the formation of a fully Democratic Constitution. I accordingly, 
hereby, ordain as follows - my Council of Ministers shall consist of the Prime Minister and 
such other Ministers as may be appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister. I have by royal 
warrant appointed Sheikh Abdullah as the Prime Minister with the effect from today. The 
Prime Minister and the other Ministers shall function as a cabinet and act on the principle of 
joint responsibility. Diwan appointed by me, shall also be a member of the Cabinet. I take this 
opportunity of giving once again a solemn assurance that all sections of my people will have 
opportunities of service, both civil and military, solely on the basis their merits and 
irrespective of creed and community. My Council of Ministers shall take appropriate steps as 
soon as restoration of normal conditions has been completed. To convene a National Assembly 
based upon adult franchise suffrage, having due regards to the principle that the number of 
representatives from each voting area should, as far as practicable, be proportionate to the 
population of that area.' 
In a way he was adopting the principles My Lords, adopted by us. 'The Constitution to be 
framed by the National Assembly shall provide adequate safeguards for the minorities and 
contain appropriate provisions guaranteeing into the freedom of conscience, freedom of 
speech, and freedom of assembly. The National Assembly as soon as the work of framing the 
new Constitution is completed, submit it through the Council of Ministers for my acceptance. 
In conclusion, I repeat and hope that the formation of a popular Interim Government and the 
inauguration in the near future of a  fully Democratic Constitution will ensure the 
contentment, happiness, and moral,  material advancement of the people.' 
So, go back to Volume II. Written Submissions compilation, Volume II, PDF Page 38 again. In 
1949, Item 24... Volume II, PDF page 38. My Lords, in a football field when there is no play, 
My Lords, that time has to be excluded. 
There's always a play going around.  
I submit to that. 
Who would better know about players than you, Mr. 
Sibal? 
I submit to that.  
 
Time out.  
'Maharaja Hari Singh issued a proclamation delegating his power and 
authority to Yuvraj Karan Singh, who would function as the Ruler of the State.' We don't have 
to go to that. 'Following his appointment as Ruler, Karan Singh nominated four 
representatives from Jammu and Kashmir to the Constituent Assembly of India. 'My Lords, 
the Constituent Assembly actually was formed in 1951. These are Constituent Assembly sorry. 
Sorry. Now 'December 1947 to September '49, Princely States underwent the process of 
integration into the Indian Union by signing merger agreements or covenants of unionization. 
The State of Jammu and Kashmir  was not a part of this process of integration.' That's 
important. 'By the covenants of unionization, various Princely States entered into covenants 
with each other to form single units. For example, through a covenant, the Princely State of 
Bhavnagar....' - My Lords Your Lordships need not read it because this is... Your Lordships 
want.... - 'Junagadh and numerous others form the United States of Saurashtra. Through a 
separate covenant, Gwalior, Indore, and 18 other princely states formed the Union State of 
Gwalior, Indore and Malwa. Similar covenants led to the formation of Patiala, East Punjab 
States Union (PEPSU), the United State of Rajasthan and the United State of Travancore and 
Cochin. Between May '48 to September '49, the States of Saurashtra, Madhya Bharat, PEPSU, 
Matsya, Rajasthan, and Travancore and Cochin signed revised Instruments of Accession, 
which inter alia enlarged the power of the dominion legislature, permitting it to enact laws on 
all matters in Lists 1 and 3, the Government of India Act 1935, and cancelled all previous 
Instruments of Accession entered into by rulers of princely states that had entered the 
covenants referred to above.  
My Lords, Your Lordships may note that no revised Instrument of Accession was signed by 
the Ruler of Jammu and Kashmir. Just note that fact My Lords. That's, we're talking about 
December '47 to September 1949. Now November 1949, through their respective rulers, 
Rajpramukhs, the States of Saurashtra, PEPSU, Rajasthan, Madhya Bharat, Mysore and 
Travancore and Cochin amongst others, issued proclamation stating that the Constitution of 
India, shortly to be adopted by the Constituent Assembly, shall be the constitution for the 
state, as for other parts of India, and shall be enforced as such in accordance with the tenor of 
its provisions. 25th of November '49, following the proclamations above, Yuvraj Karan Singh 
issued a proclamation for the State of Jammu in Kashmir that the Constitution of India shortly 
to be adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India shall, in so far as applicable to the State of 
Jammu and Kashmir, govern the constitutional relationship between the state and the 
contemplated Union of India. We don't have to go through that document because it's all set 
out here. 
 
Then 26th of January 1950. In exercise of its constituent part, the Constituent Assembly 
drafted the Constitution of India, which was adopted on November 26, 1949. The Constitution 
of India came into force in January 26 '50, repealing inter alia the Indian Independence Act. 
The Government of India act, the relationship between the Constitution and the state of 
Jammu and Kashmir was governed by Article 370 of the Constitution. It is evident that both 
the text of Article 370 and the negotiation that preceded its formulation, Article 370, could not 
be changed unilaterally by Parliament. That's My Lords, of great significance. Then My Lords, 
26th of January 1950, same day, in exercise of powers under Article 370(1) of the Constitution, 
the following consultation with the Government of Jammu and Kashmir, the President issued. 
This is the first Constitution Application to Jammu and Kashmir Order 1950. Under paragraph 
of this order, matters in the first schedule to the order were declared to correspond to matters 
ceded to the Union of India through the Instrument of Accession and subsequently the power 
of Parliament to make laws for Jammu and Kashmir was limited to such matters. 
Furthermore, paragraph 3 of the Order declared that in addition to Articles 1 and 370 of the 
Constitution, provisions specified in the second Schedule to the Order would apply to the State 
of Jammu and Kashmir. It’s important My Lords to go to this document. Volume 3 of the 
documents and My Lords PDF, page 470. Sorry, page 4. Page 4, not 470. Yes, yes, this is the 
First Constitution Order.   
My Lords, and, kindly note this. This is on the same day, on the Republic Day that he signed 
this. That's of great significance. In exercise of the powers conferred by Clause 1 of Article 370 
of the Constitution of India, the President, in consultation with the Government of the State 
of Jammu and Kashmir, is [UNCLEAR] to make the following... this order issued so and so 
and so, for the purposes of Subclause B(1) of Clause 1 of Article 370 of the Constitution, the 
matter specified in the first schedule to this order, being matters in the union list are hereby 
declared to correspond to matters specified in the Instrument of Accession, governing the 
accession of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to the Union of India as the matter with regard 
to which the dominion legislature may make laws for the State, and accordingly, the power of 
Parliament to make laws for the State shall be limited to the matter specified in the First 
Schedule. In addition to the provisions of Article 1 and Article 370 of the Constitution, the only 
other provisions of the Constitution which shall apply in relation to the State of Jammu and 
Kashmir shall be those specified in the Second Schedule to the Order, and shall so apply 
subject to the exceptions and modifications specified in the said Schedule and to the 
modifications that all references in the said provisions to the Rajpramukh shall be construed 
as references to the Sadr-e-Riyasat of Jammu and Kashmir. So, My Lords, if you look at the 
First Schedule, you will find defence, what I had indicated earlier in the Instrument of 
 
Accession. You'll find naval military. Then you will find de-limitation. Naval arms, atomic 
energy, preventive detention, foreign affairs, diplomatic relations, United Nations, 
participation in international conferences, war and peace, foreign jurisdiction, admission into 
an Immigration, emigration and expulsion from India, passports, pilgrimages, railways, 
piracies maritime. All that Your Lordships will find. That's part 
of the First Schedule. And then in the Second Schedule...  
About 96 items?  
Sorry?  
About 96 items. 
Yes, they've taken the entries of the Constitution.  
It's less than the... 
Some are skipped My Lord. They are not 96. See, 31 to 41 is missing.  
72? 
Yes, several of them are missing. 
It's only the same [UNCLEAR] number. 
That's correct. That's all that there is.  
At least one. 
Correspond to the Instrument of Accession actually, My Lords. The defence, 
military... 
No, that cannot be correct Mr. Sibal. The Instrument of 
Accession, the Schedule which you showed was far more restrictive. These are, you can say, 
these are more elaborate.  
No, My Lords, these.... 
 
They do not correspond. They.. 
No, correspond in the sense that they relate to defence. Then, I'm not saying 
anything more than that. They relate to defence. They relate to external affairs. That's all that 
I'm saying. Because the entries in the union list...  
You read out the second Schedule earlier at page 2..., if I'm 
not mistaken 196.  
Correct, correct. I'm not disputing that.  
176.  
176. 
When I said correspondence, I said the broad heads My Lord. That's all that 
I meant. Then My Lords, say this, Schedule 2 My Lords is important. Article 72(1)(c), 72(3), 
133, 134, 13... 
Just one more clarification. This is by an order? 
Yes. 
This is by an administrative order? 
Under Article 370.  
370.  
Yes, yes, that's all. That's what I told Your Lordship in the initial stage. 
Constitution of India, as applicable to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. 
Correct, correct. 
That's all I meant. Now, My Lords, kindly see these exceptions are at 72(1)(c), 
72(3). 133, 134, 135, 136,138, 145, 151. Articles 80 and 81 shall apply, subject to the 
 
modification that the representatives of the State to the Council of States and the House of the 
People respectively, shall be chosen by the President in consultation with the Government of 
the State. So that was My Lord, the variation. Article 54, 55 shall apply, subject to the 
modifications that references therein to the elected members of both Houses of Parliament 
and to each elected member of either House of Parliament shall be deemed to include 
respectively a reference to the representatives of the State in these House, those Houses, and 
to each such representative. The references to the elected members of the legislative 
assemblies of the State and to each such elected members shall be deemed to include, 
respectively, a reference to the members of the Constituent Assembly of the State and to each 
such member, and that the population of the State shall be deemed to be 44,10,000.' - My 
Lords at the moment, it's about 14 million... 140 million, My Lords, 14 crores. Now - 'Articles 
149, 150 shall apply subject to the modifications that the references therein in the state shall 
be construed as not including State of Jammu and Kashmir. Then Article 246 shall apply, 
subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this order, and Clause 2 and 3 of Article 246 shall 
not apply in relation to the State.' So no issue of repugnancy or anything like that. They can't,  
My Lords, pass a law because of the residuary power of the State. 'Then 259 shall apply subject 
to the modification is after the word until Parliament by law, otherwise  provides the words 
and the concurrence of the State to such law has been obtained shall be deemed to be inserted. 
Article 266 shall apply only insofar as it relates to the Consolidated Fund of India and the 
Public Account of India. Article 282, 284 shall apply only in insofar it relates to the Union of 
the Public Account of India. 298, 299, 300 shall apply insofar as they relate to the Union and 
shall apply only insofar as it relates to elections to Parliament and to the offices of Vice 
President, which doesn't apply to the elections in the State. 324, then 335 and then provisions 
of this part 361 shall apply only as far as it relates to President. 364, 368 shall apply provided 
further that no such amendment shall effect in relation to Jammu and Kashmir unless applied 
by order of the President under Clause 1 of 370.' So, My Lords, the point that I'm making here 
is very simple, that the Government of the day accepted the fact that our relationships with the 
Jammu and Kashmir Government are on a separate footing. The provisions of the Constitution 
unless made applicable through a Presidential Order and agreed to by the Government, shall 
not apply. The residuary power will vest in the state. It is the state which must pass laws. 
Government of India can't under... the issue of repugnancy doesn't apply. So My Lords this 
status is accepted, that's how 370 came into being and it continued. Then the distribution of 
revenues comes My Lords, that we are not really concerned with at the moment. Now kindly 
come back to Volume II, My Lords of the Written Submissions Volume II, page 41. Page 41. So 
the assumption is that if the President passes a notification for the application of any law to 
the State of Jammu and Kashmir, he has to seek concurrency. He cannot do it without 
concurrency. Consultation. So it was a collaborative relationship in a sense. There was a 
 
constant dialogue going on. This is what we wish to do and My Lords consult, the State, the 
State agrees. Which is why most of the laws were made applicable. There was hardly any law 
that was left. So in a sense, they were incorporated separately in the Constitution of India, in 
its application of the State of Jammu and Kashmir Orders.  
What happened to currency, for instance?  
Karan Singh, My Lords was the Sadr-e-Riyasat, as your Lordship knows, My 
Lord.  
Currency? 
Currency? No, currency was Indian currency. 
Because if you see currency, currency in the 
Constitution is governed by entry 36 of List 1.  
Yes. 
But there is no reference to entry 36 of List 1 in 
the Adaptation Order.  
My Lords, it will come later. There was adaptation order. Subsequent 
adaptation order. I'll come to that I'll show that to Your Lordship. Because several... this 
comes... in 1954 we have another Adaptation Order. There are several. Give me the list of 
several... we have gotten a list for Your Lordship.  
So were the subjects broadened by the 
subsequent Adaptation Order? 
Of course My Lords. Of course. They were broadened, My Lord. Every stage 
they were broadened. We have an order of 52. We have an order of 54. We have an order of 71, 
an order of 74. Because the powers were extended My Lords and the state My Lords, after 
consultation it was done. The state was ad idem with the Union My Lords. The state itself, in 
its Constitution, says that we are integrated into India. There was no question. The 
Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir itself says that we are an integral part of India. So where's 
the question? The only thing that there's this unique structural system in place, a 
 
constitutional structure, which was in place, which suddenly My Lords, on the 6th of August, 
was done away with. And My Lords, with the greatest respect, though I don't want to use that 
expression, suddenly, My Lords, in Parliament, it was said that we are doing this at 11 o' clock. 
Nobody knew about it. There was no consultation of any sort. So it was My Lords, as I said, 
the Governor of the State and Parliament, and of course, the powers that be, they decided to 
do this one fine morning and tossed it out. 
So My Lords, page 41. The Government of India published its white paper on Indian States, 
clarifying the nature of Article 370. The effect of this provision. This is important. We're talking 
about 1950 itself. The effect of this provision is that the State of Jammu and Kashmir continues 
to be a part of India. Nobody disputes it. Nobody ever disputed it. It is a unit of the Indian 
Union and the Union Parliament will have jurisdiction to make laws for the State on matters 
specified either in the Instrument of Accession or by later additions, with a concurrence of the 
Government of the State. My Lords asked me that question. Steps will be taken for the purpose 
of convening a Constituent Assembly. Your Lordship knows, My Lords, this is very important. 
At that time when My Lords, we became a Republic, 370 was there, and 370 mentions the 
Constituent Assembly. But the Constituent Assembly had not yet been convened in the State 
of Jammu and Kashmir. That was convened in 1951. December. Point is, that there was this 
understanding between the Government of India and the State, that we will have a Constituent 
Assembly which will determine the future course of action. Determine whether or not, in fact, 
should be abrogated at all or not. That decision was with the Constituent Assembly, which 
is why it is called a temporary provision. Not for any other reason. It's in that chapter of the 
Constitution. So this whole argument that this temporary provision was, 370 was temporary. 
No. It was temporary because between 1951... 
Mr Sibal what is the date of this white paper? 
1950. 
No you have not given the date. 
I'm sorry. I'll give it's at page 121. Just see the date. We'll just give it to you in 
a minute. I'll give it to Your Lordship. So, on the 1st of May 1951 now, Karan Singh, Yuvraj 
Karan Singh issued a proclamation directing the establishment of an elected Constituent 
Assembly. March, 1950, I will give the exact date. 
Okay. 
 
It is March 1950.  
It cannot be 5th July '48. 
It can't be. We'll give the date. I thought it was March. 
Article 370, wouldn't have been then.  
But in any case the idea is that it is prior to 1951. That's the whole point. 
Whatever the date is My Lord, it's prior to 1951. In other words, the Constitution envisaged a 
Constituent Assembly, which was to decide as to what would be the fate of Jammu and 
Kashmir. 15th March 1950, is what I'm told, My Lords. 
15th March? 
Anyway, let's not get into this. We'll give this. It's prior to 1951. 
Mr. Sibal, you can verify it and then give it to us later. 
I will give it. I will give it to Your Lordships. 15, sorry. They didn't correspond 
the 1950 of, the order didn't correspond. But  if you look at the 50 order, it says para 2, for the 
purposes of Subclause B(1) and Clause 1 of 370, matters specified in the First Schedule to this 
order being matters in the Union, which are thereby declared to correspond to matters 
specified in the Instrument of Accession. Just wanted to mention that. Para 2 itself. So My 
Lords, on the 1st of May 1951, Karan Singh issued a proclamation directing establishment of 
an elected Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for the State of Jammu and Kashmir. 
Then 20th of March 1952, under Article 370, Sub Article 1 of the Constitution and following 
consultation with the Government of Jammu and Kashmir, the President issued the co... 
Just wait, just one minute.  
I'm going to... read it now... that also is the same thing... the same 
Article...370 for a minute but I will give Your Lordships some... 
Just continue. Where you want, whichever way you want.  
 
No, let's read 370 because context will be clear My Lords. That's how it was 
understood at that point in time. Now we're talking about January 26, 1950. My Lords, have 
The Constitution? 
Yes. 
It says My Lords. Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the 
provisions of Article 238 shall not apply in relation to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Now 
My Lords, part A, part B, part C, part D states. That's what 238 was. So it couldn't apply. 
The Jammu Kashmir didn't fall under that category. Sui generis. The power of Parliament to 
make laws for the said State shall be limited to those matters in the union list and the 
concurrent list, which, in consultation with the Government of the State are declared by the 
President to correspond to matters specified in the Instrument of Accession governing the 
accession of the State to the Dominion of India as the matters with respect to which the 
Dominion Legislature may make laws for that state and such other matters in the said list, as 
with the concurrence of the Government of the state the President may, by order specify. So 
the items My Lords, Communication, Defence, Foreign Affairs and Consultation for all matters 
concurrence. For all of the matters concurrence.  
'Explanation - For the purposes of this Article, the Government of the State means the person 
for the time being recognized by the President as the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir being 
acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers for the time being enforced in office under the 
Maharaja's proclamation dated 5th day of March 1948.' - This explanation was added later, 
My Lord and I will point that out to Your Lordships later.  It was amended later, this particular 
explanation. - 'The provisions of Article 1 of this Article shall apply in relation to that State. 
Such of the other provisions of this Constitution shall apply in relation to the State, subject to 
such exceptions and modifications as the President may, by order specify, provided that no 
such order which relates to matters specified in the Instrument of Accession of the State 
referred to in paragraph 1 of Subclause B shall be issued except in consultation with the 
Government of the State. Provided further, that no such order, which relates to matters other 
than those referred to in the last proceeding proviso, shall be issued, except with a concurrence 
of that Government. If the concurrence of the Government of the State referred to in paragraph 
of Subclause B of Clause 1 or in second proviso to Subclause D of that clause be given before 
the Constituent Assembly for the purposes of framing the Constitution of the State is 
convened, it shall be placed before such Assembly for just decision as may be taken there on. 
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Article the President may, by 
public notification, declare that this Article shall cease to be operated or shall be operated only 
with such exceptions and modifications, and from such date as he may specify, provided that 
 
the recommendations of the Legislative Assembly of the State shall be necessary before the 
President issues a notification.' Constituent Assembly... this is now, My Lords, replaced by 
Legislative Assembly. The Constituent Assembly. So you have to have a recommendation of 
the Constituent Assembly before you could  efface 370. That's what the Constitution members 
themselves thought in 1950 and that operated till 6th of August. How could it change? 
But how long would the tenure of the Constituent 
Assembly of the state be... 
7 years.  
Sorry?  
7 years. My Lords, '51 to '57.  
So therefore with the end of the 7 years, the very 
institution of the Constituent Assembly of the State lapses. Then there's no Constituent 
Assembly left. 
Absolutely right. 
But then what happens to the proviso?  
This is the point, My Lord. 
What happens to the proviso then?  
This is the exactly the point My Lords. This is exactly the point. My Lords, 
the in between, between '51 and '57, the Constituent Assembly could take that decision.  
But thereafter... 
Thereafter, My Lords, there's no question because they formed... My Lords 
take the Constituent Assembly...  
What happens after the Constituent Assembly 
has come to an end because no Constituent Assembly can have an indefinite life.  
 
That precisely the point, My Lords. That is my point. The Constituent 
Assembly in India, when it drafted the Constitution can't have a life after the Constitution is 
framed..  
No, but equally the proviso to Clause 3 refers to 
the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the state.  
Yes.  
The substantive provision says that the President 
may by a notification, declare that the Article shall cease to be operative. Right? 
Yes. 
Now, the only safeguard is that before the 
President does so, the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the State has to be 
taken. 
Yes. 
Now, what happens at a point of time where the 
Constituent Assembly of the State ceases to exist? 
But that's the point. The President can't issue such a notification. 
According to you  after '57, it can't be done at all? 
No. After '57 it can't be. 
Then Clause 3 [UNCLEAR]. 
[UNCLEAR] 
That is why the temporary provision. 
 
One more fundamental issue, which is that 
notwithstanding the fact that the proviso ceases to operate, Clause 3, the substantive part 
continues to hold the field. 
No, it is dependent on the proviso. 
No. 
With respect no My Lords. With respect, any proviso.... 
If the proviso, I mean, there are ways in which 
you can construe a proviso. But if the proviso ceases to operate by virtue of the fact that the 
tenure of a Constituent Assembly of the state has ceased to exist, surely the substantive part 
of 3 still continues to remain.  
Kindly see the scheme of 370, My Lord, with the greatest respect. Kindly see 
the scheme of 370. On the four items My Lords, that is Defence, Communications, External 
Affairs, and ancillary matters, My Lords, the consultation of the State is necessary under 370. 
For all other matters the concurrence of the State is necessary. So can you say you do away 
with the concurrence? And then the third thing is if you want to abrogate 370, then it... or 
amend it, you have to get the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly. 
So long as it exists.  
I'm sorry, My Lord. This is the point. That's why I said initially, the 
Constituent Assembly has served its term when a Constitution is framed.  
So in which case, then what happens is if your 
construction is right, 370, which is essentially a transitional provision assumes the character 
of a permanent position.. 
No, it is a transitional... 
... by virtue of the fact that there is no 
Constituent Assembly of the state after 1957. constraint to simply have the state after 1957.  
 
Absolutely. It's a transitional provision between 1951 and 1957, when the 
Constituent Assembly could take that decision. Could take that decision, it was left to the 
people of Kashmir. 
According to you, after 1957, Sub-article 3 has become redundant? 
My Lords Constituent Assembly, even in the context of Constitution of India, 
is redundant.  
So there is no... 
You can't revive a Constituent Assembly.  
So, there is no method according to you... 
Yes. 
... by which either with consultation assembly or 
advice can 370 at all be...   
My Lords, even the amendment that is made ultimately, they convert the 
Legislature into a Constituent Assembly.  
That's a different matter. I... 
No, no. That tells you their understanding. Please appreciate that. It is their 
understanding of the Constitution. 
Mr. Sibal, there are two separate aspects. One is 
interpretation of Clause 3 of Article 370 and the proviso to that. 
Yes. 
The second part is what the amendments have been made, 
and how you interpret it. 
Yes. My Lords, I can't hear Your Lordships. 
 
One is, interpretation of Clause 3 to Article 370, has to be 
done independently of the amendments. So your contention is the proviso specifically applies, 
and unless the proviso is resorted to and cannot be resorted to after 1957, Clause 3 will not be 
applicable. That's your sum and substance. 
Yes, yes absolutely. That is absolutely right, My Lord. That's absolutely right. 
Just as Clause 2(3) has worked itself out. The point is, why was this Clause put in 1950? 
Because in 1950 they said, we'll have a Constituent Assembly. See the Constituent Assembly 
debates. It will be made clear. No. But the fact is, in 370 at that time the Constituent Assembly 
was not there. The whole purpose was...        
To offset your submission, we'll have to postulate 
that Clause 3 becomes a sort of a constitutional article which falls into [UNCLEAR] after seven 
years.  
Yes, yes, absolutely.  
How can that be? Clause 3 still continues to 
survive.  
My Lords I... 
The limitation on Clause 3 may not, may cease 
to operate. 
My Lords, kindly see 369. Continues, My Lords. Kindly see, 369. Temporary 
powers to Parliament to make laws. That's the part. Part 21 My Lords. 
See, 371 begins with a non obstante clause. It 
overrides the entirety of the Constitution. 
Absolutely My Lord. 
But Clause 3 contains a non obstante clause, 
which overrides Clause 1 as well.  
 
Yes.  
So therefore, notwithstanding, because 371 
makes special provisions in relation to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. 
Correct. Correct.  
But 373 has a non obstante provision that 
overrides the non obstante clause in Clause 1. 
For that period. My Lord, we are not disputing that. What Your Lordships is 
putting to me, there is a structure in place that was envisaged by the Constitution in 1950. At 
that time there was no Constituent Assembly. Why did they mention Constituent Assembly? 
Need not have mentioned it. Kindly, look at it from that point of view. What was the reason to 
mention Constituent Assembly in 370, when it was not even in place? They could have said 
Government of Jammu and Kashmir. Why did the Constitution makers My Lords, include the 
term Constituent Assembly in 3? Because they knew that the Constituent Assembly will frame 
a Constitution.  
Really, there was no limited... the acceptance of 
sovereignty of the dominion of India was complete. They didn't say in the Instrument of 
Accession that we accept the sovereignty of the Union of India for some limited purposes. They 
accepted the sovereignty for all intents and purposes. Now that acceptance of sovereignty was 
complete. But they reserved certain rights to themselves over certain legislative subjects. So in 
that sense, the accession was complete. The acceptance of sovereignty was complete. Now 
consistent with that, therefore it said, that in Clause 3, that the Union of India would have, the 
President of India would have the right to abrogate Article 370.  
Not the Union of India. 
The condition that subject to the 
recommendation of the President... 
Not the Union of India, My Lord. On the recommendation of the Constituent 
Assembly. No, Union of India has no right to tell it is recommended. The word is 
recommendation of the Constituent Assembly. Then they can exercise that right. That's how 
you interpret a proviso. You can't say that, they are the right sovereign. Forget the proviso. 
 
Even the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly because it doesn't exist. Then 63, 68(2) 
proviso also goes My Lords. Therefore, and the reason is simple, My Lords. The genesis of 
which was the fact that in 370 itself, it was mentioned that the Constituent Assembly has a role 
to play in the abrogation of 370. Otherwise, if Your Lordship says, it had no role to play, there 
was no need for 370, Sub-article 3. And My Lords, look at the concurrence power. Even those 
powers were of no relevance thereafter, because the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir was 
in place. There was no need for concurrence anymore. Because now you have a Constitution 
of the Jammu and Kashmir. So, that also became otiose. You have to see My Lords, the 
historical perspective in the context of a Jammu and Kashmir ultimately signed the 
Instrument of Accession. Nobody disputes they are integrated into India but, subjected to a 
constitutional provision. 
Therefore, the submission is that once the period 
stipulated in the proviso to Clause 3 had come to an end... 
Yes. 
the power under Clause 3 itself came to end?  
Because it's no longer alive. The Constituent Assembly, like in India, My 
Lords, can for example, today, today, My Lords there can't be a provision in the Constitution 
of India with reference to a Constituent Assembly because the Constituent Assembly has 
worked itself out. It has formed the Constitution. Now, if it is decided that they would abrogate 
370, the Constituent Assembly would have said we abrogate 370. Which is why it was a 
temporary provision, not because of the fact that under the, as a Union of India it was deemed 
to be temporary. How could it... 
Sorry, interrupting you at this stage. 
That may be... just putting a question... I am not...If one looks at Article 370 Clause.. Clause 
1(b). 
1(b), yes. 
'The power of the Parliament to make laws for the State shall 
be limited to' - it says -'Matters in the union list and the concurrent list in consultation with 
the... which in consultation with the Government of the States are declared by the President 
 
to correspond to matters specified in the Instrument of Accession governing the accession of 
the State to the Dominion of India.' 
Right 
'(2) such other matters in the list, as with the concurrence of 
the State... Government of the State, the President may in the order may specify.' 
Yes 
Then explanation deals with what is meant by the 
concurrence of the State. 
Right. 
Then it says that provided that no such order... the first 
proviso - 'Provided that no such order is relates to the matter specified in the Instrument of 
Accession of the State referred to in paragraph 1 of Sub clause (b) shall be issued  except in 
consultation with the Government of the State.'  
Correct.  
'Provided further that no such order which relates to matters 
other than those specified in the last preceding proviso shall be issued, except with the 
concurrence of the Government.' 
That's right.  
So the second proviso talks about concurrence of the 
Government. Now if one looks at Clause 2... 
Yes 
It deals with a situation where the Assembly or the 
Government or the State is not there. It deals with the period when the Constitution Assembly 
was... of the State was in existence but the Government or the elected Assembly was not in 
existence. And therefore the proviso to Clause 3 will only be applicable as long as the 
 
Government of the State or the Assembly is not elected because election of the Assembly will 
take place after the Constituent Assembly of the  State of the Jammu and Kashmir enacts the 
Constitution. 
The Government was always in place from day one, My Lord...  
No, no, maybe so. 
Government is there since day one. 
That appears to be the broad... that appears to be the broad 
outline of this.... outline of Article 370. What Clause 2... when it refers to the Constituent 
Assembly of the State, which is for the purpose of Constitution of the framing Constitution of 
the State which shall be placed before the Assembly for such decision as may be taken thereon.  
Correct.  
So Constituent Assembly of the State makes a Constitution, 
frames the Constitution. It goes before the Constitution.  
No. It can state in the Constitution that 370 is abrogated. What problem does 
it... it has the power. That's why there is a Constituent Assembly. And it says My Lords, 
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions, kindly note that. Notwithstanding. My 
Lords, 37(1)(b)(1) and 37(2) notwithstanding any of that.  So My Lords, you start the Article 
by saying, notwithstanding anything in this Constitution and 3 starts with notwithstanding 
anything in the foregoing provisions. That is, notwithstanding the opening part of the Article 
also. There was a Government... Yes. 
Still the Constituent Assembly of the State...  
Yes.  
If Sub-article 3 according to you, has become non-existent ceased 
to be operative, then how the very temporary nature of Article 370 will survive?  
 
That's why. Because it's temporary, because the Constituent Assembly had 
not been framed My Lord. At that point in time it not been constituted in 1950, when this 
provision was added in the Constitution.  
No. If Sub-Article 3 goes then that means Article 370 can never 
be abrogated.   
Yes, that's the whole point, My Lords. That is our case.  
Then how it is temporary? 
It is temporary, because when this article was framed, My Lords, there was 
no Constituent Assembly, it was a Constituent Assembly, which they could have taken the 
decision that we will abrogate 370 and merge completely with the Union of India, like any 
other state.. 
Mr Sibal, your contention if I've understood you 
correctly, is that the temporary nature of 370 is co-relatable to the Constituent Assembly life. 
And in a way Sub-clause 3 becomes otiose once the Constituent Assembly ceased to exist. This 
is your contention.  
This is my contention. 
From ''51 to ''57 is temporary  
And Your Lordships in the Constituent Assembly, they say the same thing. 
<UNCLEAR>, they say the same thing, what I am saying.  
I'm just trying to phrase it as I understand it.  
I'm clear Your Lordships have understood it. And I also understand Your 
Lordships, what Your Lordships are thinking. So I have to respond to it. 
According to you it was temporary between '51 to '57. 
That's correct.  
 
And thereafter permanent. 
The reason is simple My Lords. All Constituent Assemblies are temporary. 
There is no permanence in a Constituent Assembly. 
Role is limited to framing the Constitution. 
Yes. Therefore My Lords, if it is temporary by its nature, which is why I 
started by saying this is a political exercise. That's why I started with that submission before 
Your Lordships. The formation of a Constituent Assembly is a political exercise to ensure that 
the people within the territory of a particular region, their aspirations are taken into account 
to formulate a law and a Constitution to ensure that those aspirations are met in future times 
to come. This is not a lawmaking exercise, then they frame the Constitution to take into 
account those aspirations. That's how our Republic came into force. Because there was a 1935 
Act, there was diversity. My Lords, kindly look at it historically. Let's once forget the law for a 
moment. Look at it historically. If you look at Europe and the making of the nation states in 
Europe, how did that happen? It happened because there were large empires. The Austrio- 
Hungarian Empire, Russian Empire, and those large empires had communities and within 
those empires, there were peoples of different languages, of different cultures, of different 
ethnic lot. So it is the breakup of the Empire that led to the rise of the nation state. The Treaty 
of Utrecht, the 1848 revolutions, right? In India, the process was the opposite. It's the only 
exception. The purpose was just the opposite. There was disparity, they were existing 
disparities. There were 562 princely states. There were states which were part of the British 
Crown. They had to be amalgamated, and each of them had certain conditions. But then 
ultimately, they all agreed. Okay, for the states that were part of 562, all agreed. But this 
particular state of Jammu and Kashmir was an exception. And the exception was 
constitutionally grafted in Article 370 and the terms of the exception were constitutionally 
engrafted in 370. You can't jettison the people of the of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and 
decide that what's the difference between this and My Lords, the act of the Crown. What's the 
difference between this and the annexation of Junagadh? Or the annexation of Hyderabad? 
Then it's an act of paramountcy, that I am the Union and I will decide. When you have 
constitutionally committed yourself that if this is to be done, you have to follow a process 
which two sovereign authorities have agreed upon and is grafted in Article 370. Otherwise My 
Lord, then it's exercise of paramount power. 
 
In the assimilative exercise carried out, your 
submission as I understand is J&K is an exception because a temporary provision was created 
for a period of time and after that it is engrafted permanently into the Constitution. 
Because you can't revive the Constituent Assembly. 
I'm just saying. I understand what you are saying. 
That's what my submission is. I appreciate. Your Lordships have fully 
understood what I am trying to say. What is it that we have? You have a state of Jammu and 
Kashmir with today 14 million people. At that time, there were much less. They have no role 
to play in their own state, they have no role to play. If in 1950 it was part of the Union, there 
would be no issue. The aspirations, the desires of the people, whatever it is My Lord. After all, 
this was something that also had international repercussions at that point in time. 
If an elected assembly would want to abrogate 370 
even that is not possible? 
Not possible. Not possible. That is why they had to My Lords do these things 
in the manner that they did.  
But the only way we can reach to that conclusion 
is by saying that once the period for the work of the Constituent Assembly of the State comes 
to an end, then what is essentially a temporary provision assumes a permanent character in 
the Constitution.  
But that... yes. Your Lordship is right, except... 
But if that hypothesis is not accepted, then the 
only basis on which you can really place your petitions here, is that by asserting that a pre-
constitution compact, which were entered into between an independent state and a state in 
which it has merged, so to speak, is enforceable, irrespective of what the legislative power of 
the merging state is.  
Because My Lord, the legislative power, both of the Parliament here cannot 
override My Lords the powers under 356 of the Constitution. Because what is being used is 
356, there is no such power by, under 356 that can My Lord take.....  
 
Can an independent state which accepts the 
sovereignty of another state unconditionally still say that, well, if the Parliament of that State, 
to which we have assumed sovereignty of, is still restrained in terms of the original compact? 
It's unconditional, My Lords, it's unconditional. And apart from... forget 
about that. Can Parliament of India, My Lord, Parliament of India, in the context of its 
responsibilities and powers under the Constitution of India, do an act beyond 356? Can't. 
There are very complex issues that Your Lordships will have to decide. This power is exercised 
under 356. How is that can be exercised under 356? 356 itself is a temporary power. Whatever 
you are trying to say to me... 
Sibal, what you are saying is you see, which means 
even, let us say a hypothesis that the will of the people is to abrogate it which is reflected by an 
assembly election. You are saying, even that scenario it cannot be done. Try to understand the 
context. Sequitur would be even then it cannot be done. 
But that would be a political act My Lords. I would say that if that situation 
arises, it would be a political act. That's not been done, but be that as it may. My Lords, kindly 
look at it from this point of view. 356 itself is a temporary provision. What's the purpose of 
356? To distort democracy. Is the intention behind a 356 provision, which is a temporary 
provision to decimate democracy?  
No Mr. Sibal, let's keep 356 aside for the time being  because 
we are now interpreting, we are interpreting Clause 3. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I appreciate what My Lords... 
We can't bring... 
No, no, I'm only saying these are issues that will arise. 
If one looks at it carefully, Clause, Sub Clause (b)(2) says 
such are the matters in the said list with the concurrence of the government of the state, the 
President may by order specify. So, all other matters which are not included in Clause 1... 
Requirement.  
 
....can be, can be, now the Parliament of the country can 
legislate with the concurrence... 
Yes. 
...of the Government of the state. Now what is meant by the 
concurrence of the government of the state is specified in Clause 2... 
Yes. 
...as long as there is no Legislative Assembly. In that case, it's a 
Constituent Assembly, which will have the power. 
Yes. 
And after the State Assembly has been constituted, then it 
will be placed before the State Assembly.  
Correct.  
That's the  purpose of Clause 2. 
Yes, you are absolutely right. So that has also worked itself out. 
But, once the State Assembly has been constituted in terms 
of the Constitution of the state, then it is governed by the proviso first, and the second proviso 
to Clause 1, which says, provided that no such order, which relates to matter specified, matters 
specified so and so, so and so in consultation with the Government of the State, concurrence 
is not required because it's already included in the order of Accession. The second proviso 
applies when it is not included in the order of Accession it says, provided further, that no such 
order which relates to matters referred to in the last provision shall be accepted with the 
concurrence of the Government. So all that is required is concurrence of the Government. 
Right. 
 
But to say that the proviso to Clause 3 will operate even after 
the Constitution... 
No, it says -'This Article shall cease to operate', not just any law. That 'this 
Article shall cease to operate'. There's a difference My Lords. Actually, proviso 1 and proviso 2 
have worked themselves out because now you have a Constitution.  
Yes, it's not worked itself out. It will continue to apply as long 
as it is based on concurrence of the State. 
That's right. And in between the Constitution in 1957 is framed My Lords. So 
that there was no CO after that except for the ones. There were a couple of COs, but ultimately 
it's in three. It's in... that is different. See it says - 'notwithstanding anything in foregoing 
reason of this Article, this Article.'  
We are interpreting 370. Let's look at Clause B, 
C, and D for a moment.  
Yeah. 
B, C, and D cover two types of situations. One, it 
covers entries of the union list and the concurrent list. 
Yes. 
And it covers substantive provisions of the 
Constitution also. Now Clause B refers to the power of Parliament to make laws for the State.  
Yes.  
And it restricts it in two ways. First - those 
matters which are governed by the Instrument of Accession, those entries in the union list and 
in the concurrent list which are referable to the Instrument of Accession... 
The Instrument of Accession. 
 
...insofar as it reserves powers to Parliament, 
those have to be specified by the Government of India, by the President in consultation with 
the State.  
Absolutely.  
So (b)(1) refers to those matters in the union list 
and the concurrent list. 
Right. 
(b)(2) refers to such other matters in the said 
lists, in which concurrence of the Government of the State is concerned, right? So the entirety 
of (b) is confined to matters in the union list and the concurrent list.  
Correct. Correct.  
Now come to Clause C.  
Yes.  
Clause C refers to substantive article of the 
Constitution. Article 1.  
Yes. 
Right?  Now we come to Clause D. 
And 370, not just Article 1.  
Right. And of this Article'.  
You are right. And of this Article. 
And now Clause D. Clause D refers to such of the 
other provisions of this Constitution, they shall apply in relation to that State, subject to such 
exceptions and modification as the President may by order specify.  
 
Correct.  
So Clause D now is beyond the ambit of Clause 
A. Clause A refers only to the entries of the union list and the concurrent list, right? Clause B 
refers to the other provisions of the Constitution, apart from the union and the concurrent list.  
1 and 370. This is the problem.  
Right. Now look at the proviso it to Clause D.  
Yes. 
The proviso says that - 'No such order which 
relates to the matters specified in the Instrument of Accession of the State referred to in 
paragraph 1 of Subclause B shall be issued except in consultation of the Government of the 
State.' In other words, the first proviso refers to the entries of the union list and the concurrent 
list, right?  
Yes. 
The second proviso further 'provided further, 
that no such order' - now, which is such order? It refers to the order which is referred to in the 
first proviso. Therefore, the use of the word 'such order'- 'which relates to matters other than 
those referred to in the last preceding proviso, shall be issued except with the concurrence of 
that Government.' In other words, the whole area of concurrence, consultation and consent is 
confined to the entries of the union list and the concurrent list because it's very clear from the 
whole scheme. (B)(1) - Matters in the union list and the concurrent list. (B)(2) - Such as the 
matters in the union and the concurrent list. Then go to Clause D. Clause D refers to the 
provisions of the Constitution.  
Provisions of this Constitution.  
Of this Constitution. 
Yeah. 
 
Right?  
Subject to... 
Now, the Presidential power, the Presidential 
power to, the Presidential power... the power of Parliament or such of the provision of this 
Constitution shall apply in relation to the State, subject to such exceptions and modification 
of the President, may by order, specify. In other words, the President is given an untrammelled 
power to specify which are the provisions of the Constitution, which shall apply to the State of 
Jammu and Kashmir. That is conditioned by the first proviso and the second proviso. 
Right. 
But the first proviso and the second proviso don't 
relate to the substantive provision of the Constitution at all. They only refer to the matters 
governed in the union list and the concurrent list. 
Only the first proviso, not second. 
One second. 
Orders My Lord. 
Right. You're right. Deals with the Presidential 
order. 
The first proviso mentions the list, not the second proviso.  
D recognizes as inhering in the President, the 
power to decide which of the substantive provision of the Constitution shall apply to Jammu 
and Kashmir. Now that power of the President is conditioned by the first and the second 
proviso.  
Yes. 
But the first and second proviso to Clause D.... 
 
No see, provided further that no such order shall relate. 
So no such order means the order referred to in 
the first proviso. And the first proviso only refers to Clause 1 of Subclause D. 
These are only orders, My Lords, these are only orders. These are orders My 
Lord.  
I understand that. Yes. No, no, one second. 
You're not getting the point. The point is this that D refers to an order which may be passed 
by the President, making applicable provisions of the Constitution to the state of Jammu and 
Kashmir with adaptations or modification. Now the question, including the list.. Now, yes, 
now what the first proviso says is that, "No such order, which relates to matters specified in 
the Instrument of Accession specified in paragraph 1 of Clause B shall be issued except with 
consultation." 
Correct. That is Instrument of Accession, My Lord. 
But that pertains only to the entries in the union 
list and the concurrent list. 
Yes. 
Absolutely.  
The second proviso, My Lord. 
Now the second proviso. Now the second proviso 
says, "Provided, that no such order.." 
Yes. 
"..which relates to matters other than those 
referred  to in the last preceding proviso." 
Concurrence. 
 
Therefore... 
Which includes D, My Lord? 
No. It refers only... It cannot. I'll tell you why. 
Provided further, that no such order. No such order means which order? The order referred to 
in the first proviso. And the order..... 
D also mentions orders, My Lord.  
Sorry? 
D also mentions the order. 
Both provisos towards such <UNCLEAR> order in 
D. 
Just one minute. 
D also says the same thing. Order specify. 
Honourable Chief Justice, My Lords in the morning I'd 
mentioned a matter. I had a urgency that there are 23 protests going on simultaneously. We 
have a very volatile situation due to very unfortunate situations that happened in the 
neighbouring state in Haryana and Nuh. Now there are 23 protests going on in Delhi. 
Have you circulated your email?  
We have sent it to the... 
I'll pass orders immediately. 
If Your Lordship could please...<UNCLEAR> 
Of course. Thats what the circulates it,... I'll do 
that. 
 
Can I hand over hard copies of the IA, My Lords. 
You have circulated an email right? I'll pass 
orders. 
But the email went to the learned registrar judicial because we 
couldn't find another email that... 
He doesn't even allow me to use the washroom. 
He's waiting just outside to take orders the moment I come to my chambers.  
Right. We also circulated to the Honourable Court Master My 
Lord. Your Lordship's Court Master.              
<<LUNCH BREAK>> 
Yes please.  
May I just My Lords very simply state, what I think is the architecture of 370. 
Yes. 
Let's go back to it My Lords. Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, 
the provisions of Article 238 shall not reply in relation to Jammu and Kashmir. That's done 
away with now My Lords, because those are Part A, Part B, Part C, Part D states, therefore My 
Lord that's over. We are not part of any of those States. The power of Parliament, now here My 
Lords, it is relates to the power of Parliament, to make laws. Just kindly note that. 
That's the ordinary lawmaking power. 
The ordinary lawmaking power for the State shall be limited, now that's 
important. Even the lawmaking power is limited to those matters in the union list and the 
concurrent list. Your Lordships will see, state list is out because residuary power is in the state, 
 
which in consultation with the Government of the State are declared by the President, to 
correspond to matters specified in the Instrument of Accession governing the accession of the 
state to the Dominion of India as the matters with respect to which the Dominion Legislature 
may make laws in that state. So that's that list My Lord. 
We saw the list in the morning.  
The list in the morning. So it is only qua those that Parliament may make 
laws but that also with consultation, and consultation is mentioned here itself. Doesn't have 
to be repeated in the proviso, it's mentioned here itself. Correct, My Lords? That also has to be 
consultation. And just My Lords clarify the architecture, that's with consultation. Now you 
come to B. Such other matters that is again, the power of Parliament to make laws. Such other 
matters in the said list so, apart from the list that are in the Instrument of Accession such other 
matters in the said list... 
No, This list refers to union and concurrent list.  
Yes, only List 1 and 3.  
1 and 3.  
Right. As with the concurrence of the government, so now My Lords, the law 
has to be also with concurrence of the government. So we are dealing only with laws here. Law 
making power, that's the first My Lords, limb of the argument.  
That's the restriction on the lawmaking power.  
That's the law making power. Concurrence is mentioned here in respect of 
other matters. No proviso is required. Here no proviso is required. Now, let's leave the 
explanation for the moment. The provisions of Article 1 and this article shall apply, 'C' the 
provisions of Article 1 and of this article shall apply in relation to that state. So this is Article 1 
and this Article 370, this becomes relevant for D, My Lords ultimately. Now come to D. 'D' 
starts with the word..... Now, D doesn't deal with laws. It deals with proclamation and orders 
of the President. Provisions, such of the other provisions of this... I pause here, My Lords, 
others excluding 1 and 370. So D is, C says the provisions of Article 1 and of this Article shall 
apply in relation to that state and D says such of the other provisions that is excluding 1 and 
 
shall apply in relation to that state, subject to such exceptions and modifications as the 
President may, by order specify. 
Just one minute. C cannot be read in isolation without 
reading Sub-clause 1. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution... 
Correct. 
... the provisions of Article 1, and this Article shall apply in 
relation to that state. So that means only that Article 1 and this Article will apply, only in 
relation to that state.  
That's what I'm saying My Lord, nothing more. Then read D.  
if one reads D... 
Such of the other provisions. 
Correct.  
Which means 1 and 370.  
... as well as other than the matters in the 
concurrent and the union list.  
Correct. 
That also. I agree. and 238 also. 
Just one minute. 
My Lord Khanna's reading is that, it will include 
D... sorry, C, but exclude A, and B. 
That cannot be, My Lord.  
 
It will, it will. Otherwise, it will lead to a situation, you are 
saying that 370 is a permanent article.  
My Lords, we come to that later.  
One second. That's your argument. 370 is a permanent 
article which cannot be undone by… even with a concurrence… 
That we forget that I made that argument.  
Right now, you're just giving us the structure of 
the Article.  
Forget that what I made that argument. It is temporary, it is temporary on 
26th of January 1950. Let's forget about anything else. It is temporary. Why? Because My 
Lords, the Constituent Assembly may still choose to, so it’s temporary. There's nothing wrong 
with that heading. Let me finish the architecture, and then I'll come back My Lord. So, My 
Lords, I was reading, these such of the other provisions of the Constitution… so that is other 
than 1 and 370… shall...  and 238… shall apply in relation to that state, subject to such 
exceptions and modifications as the President may, by order, specify. Now, you come to 
See the colon 
My Lords. Specify colon, right? … provided that no such order, which relates to the matter 
specified in the Instrument of Accession. Again, My Lords... of the State, referred to in 
paragraph 1 of sub-clause B, shall be issued except in consultation with the government of that 
state. Again, a colon. Provided further, that no such order, which relates to matters other than 
those referred to in the last preceding proviso, shall be issued except with the concurrence. 
You go to B(1) and B(2). So, that was the law, the same template. Now the orders for the rest 
of the provisions. Then read 2, My Lords. If the concurrence of the government of the state, 
referred to in paragraph 2 of sub-clause B of Clause 1, or in 2nd proviso to sub-clause D of that 
Clause be given before the Constituent Assembly, for the purpose of framing the Constitution 
of the state is convened, it shall be placed before such assembly for such decision that may be 
taken thereon. Same template of B and D My Lords. And they can reject it, they need not 
confirm it. That's how you that's how you retain sovereignty, which is the Instrument of 
Accession. And, if you don't retain it, it's temporary. That's why it's temporary. I'm just trying 
to explain… 
 
…the structure of 370. You complete Clause 3, 
then I have one question.  
Sure, I’ll… 
No, first you can complete, otherwise I’ll be 
breaking your link. It’s on some unrelated area, before… 
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provision. So, My Lords, it's 
notwithstanding, the ‘notwithstanding’ in the beginning of the Article, please note that. 
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Article. So notwithstanding the 
notwithstanding in 370, the President may, by public notification declare that the Article shall 
cease to be operative or shall be operative only with such exceptions and modifications, and 
from such date as he may specify provided that the recommendation of the Constituent 
Assembly shall be necessary before the President issues such a notification. So if the 
Constituent Assembly recommends it, namely, that we want to abrogate 370, then on that 
recommendation, the President will issue a notification and this Article is contained in Sub 
Clause 3.  It doesn't have to be in D. So that according to me is the architecture of 370. 
Mr. Sibal, I have just one question on this.  D(1) 
refers to those matters in the instruments of Accession, which have been ceded by the 
Maharaja to the Union, the Dominion's power.  B(2) refers to all other matters in the union 
and concurrent list other than what is covered by 1.. 
Fair enough.  
Now suppose in the area of the union and the 
concurrent list something is not covered by B (1) or by B (2). In other words it's not referable 
to those subjects mentioned in the instrument of accession, and it's not covered by B (2) at all. 
That power is not entrusted to the state? 
B (2) are all are the list, My Lord.  
No, no. B(2) says such other matters in the said 
list, as with the concurrence of the Government, the President may order specific 
<UNCLEAR> 
 
Almost all matters in the list. 
Right, right. Of course it covers....It's a 
residuary. 
Everything, My Lord, everything. 
Yeah, so you have to take concurrence of the 
state.  
Yes. 
Now suppose this is not covered by B(2) in the 
sense that there is no concurrence of the State. right. It's not covered by B(1), and you have not 
taken the concurrence of the State under B(2).  
Correct. 
On such an aspect, the State Legislature cannot 
exercise power because it's not in the state list. One second... 
Residuary power of the State. 
One second. The state legislature is operating on 
the state list. 
And residuary power, My Lords. 
Residuary power came in when and under what? 
In Kashmir it was there from the beginning . 
Where does the residuary  power find... 
Yes I'll show that Your Lordship, this is part of the instrument itself.  
Instrument of accession? 
 
Yes, it is part of My Lords, all orders of the government. 
No, but has specifically there is a .... 
It's also part of the Constitution, My Lords...I'll show that. 
I just wanted to see whether it's part of the 
Constitution 
Yes, yes. Your Lordships may take it.  
Otherwise, there'll be a peculiar situation, where 
neither Parliament can exercise power nor can the State Legislature exercise power. 
I will take Your Lordships' point. I will demonstrate to Your Lordships, the 
residuary power was with the State Legislature throughout and with the State Government 
throughout. That was the condition on which My Lords the accession took place. And I will 
demonstrate that Your Lordships. That's the least of my problems.  
Mr. Sibal, it's slightly different. 
Yes. 
Which is very different from what is subject matter of 1 and 
2.  
Yes. Right.  
Because they do not deal with abrogation of the Article.  
Absolutely yes, Absolutely. Your Lordship is right.  
And therefore when we read at that power, which is 
specifically conferred on the President, then proviso, leave aside for the time being the proviso. 
Do you agree with that interpretation?  
 
No, I don't... 
For the time being just leave the proviso.  
I can't read the Constitution in this fashion. I can't even act in that fashion, 
let's forget the Constitution. How do I leave the proviso when the  Constitution is staring us in 
the face? 
No, no the question was... 
Your Lordship is putting... 
Clause 3 deals with abrogation of the Article itself, which is 
not the subject matter of 1 and 2. 
No. It's subject matter of C, Article 1 shall apply to the State, My Lords. 
Correct. but it deals with complete abrogation of the article 
itself.  
Agreed. 
And in that context you may argue that your argument of the 
first fold was, it will be only if the condition of the proviso is satisfied that Clause 3 will apply 
Otherwise if the conditions of the proviso is not satisfied Clause 3 will not apply. 
That's how Your Lordships have interpreted proviso since 1950. That's all 
that I can say. I can't say more than that.  
Proviso may, in some cases be an exception, a 
proviso may in some cases be an elaboration.  
There's a difference, My Lords.  
It depends upon the nature of the...   
Provisos are sometimes change colours. 
 
Proviso, that the recommendation, provided that the recommendation of the 
Legislative of the Constituent Assembly shall be necessary. It's a restriction on the exercise of 
power. That's referred to in Clause 2, My Lords.  
To interpret Clause 3, to say that the power existed and then 
will vanish once the Constituent Assembly of the State is no longer exists.  
Kindly read 2, My Lords. If the concurrence of the government of the State 
referred to in Para 2, Subclause B, of 1 or the second proviso to D of that clause be given before 
the Constituent Assembly for the purpose of, for the purpose of framing of the Constitution, 
of... that is the purpose. 
Mr Sibal, you have contradicted yourself. When you referred 
to Clause C, subclause C as an independent clause and Clause D not applicable to Clause C, 
then the second proviso will not apply.  
No, what I am saying is in both cases,  
And therefore only Subclause 3 will apply.  
My Lords, the point is Clause 2 says that even for the purposes of those 
notifications...  
Anyway we will examine that.  
Yes.  
We have understood your line of argument. 
No, no there is something that's missing My Lords. The proviso says, 
provided that the recommendations of the Constituent Assembly of the State referred to in 
Clause 2. Why are they saying that My Lords? The purpose is given in Clause 2, provided that 
the recommendations of the Constituent Assembly of the State referred to in Clause 2 shall be 
necessary for the President, before the President, before the President issued such a 
notification. It is necessary... and before he issues it. How can you say it is explanatory, or that 
 
it's an independent clause? It specifies how it is to happen. It has to happen before, that is the 
permission has to be had before.  
You know, the reason why it refers Clause 3, 
refers to the Constituent Assembly of the State referred to in Clause 2 is because Clause 2 refers 
to the Constituent Assembly for the purpose of framing the Constitution.  
That's correct. That's exactly my point.  
That's your point. We get your point. Now, 
therefore the reference the recommendation of which Constituent Assembly. This makes it 
very clear that one and only Constituent Assembly, which was formed for the purpose of 
framing of the State Constitution. 
Absolutely right. 
Once the framing of the Constitution was done 
then that purpose of Constituent Assembly, Constituent Assembly is not like a permanent 
body, like Parliament is a permanent body. The Supreme Court is a permanent body.  
No doubt about it  
It's a body which has a specific purpose and 
thereafter it becomes functus officio so to speak. Therefore, once the Constituent Assembly 
had fulfilled its purpose then the proviso itself has no application.  
This is the problem, My Lords. The problem there is, then you are applying, 
applying 3 without the proviso and saying this is a blanket power. Then it's a, then the 
President can do it anytime without any consultation. He just passes an order. 
Mr Sibal? 
I integrate...I integrate... 
Mr Sibal, one thing which we have to bear in 
mind is all these provisions are in Part 21. Part 21 has used three expressions temporary, 
transitional and special.  
 
Correct.  
Temporary provisions are those which are 
intended to be in existence for a limited period of time,  
That's right. 
But without a point of terminus, right? A 
temporary government servant, that person is temporary for a limited period of time but 
whose services are to be terminated. Until you are terminating the service of that person, that 
person still continues. That's the broad concept, you know of temporary.  
Absolutely.  
Transitional means something which necessarily 
has a terminus.  
That's right. Laws made earlier... 
I will show you some of the transitional 
provisions of this part. And third is special. Now we'll see for instance, after 370, we'll get some 
idea from the provisions after 370, say 371. Special provision with respect to Maharashtra and 
Gujarat. 371 A - special provision for Nagaland.  
Yes. Yes.  
Then we get 371 B - special provision for Assam.  
Correct. 
371 C - special division for Manipur. 
That’s correct. 
D - for the state of Andhra Pradesh and 
Telangana. E - establishment of central university in AP. F - a special provision for Sikkim, 
 
which came in ’75. G - Mizoram. H - special provision for Arunachal. Then I - for state of Goa. 
J - for the state of Karnataka.  
Right.  
Now, after these special provisions end, we come 
to 372, which continues continuance in force of existing laws. Which then says, “Shall continue 
in force until altered or appealed or amended by competent legislature, or by any other…” like 
the Penal Code. It just continued in force until it is altered. Then similarly now, we have 372-
A, power of the President adopt laws. And it says, the President may by order, made before the 
1st of November 1957, make such adaptations and modifications. So, this was a transitional 
provision, that the President had to make those adaptations by the 1st of November 1957. So, 
it was a transitional provision. After that, the power lapses. So, similarly, 373 was… Then, came 
the provisions relating to the judges. Judges whose services had to be taken over by the Union 
of India, Public Service Commissions, so on and so forth. And then, 392, the power of the 
President to remove difficulties.  
Right.  
So therefore, Part 21, basically covers special 
provisions, temporary provisions, and transitional provisions. Now, it doesn't use the 
expression ‘transitional’ in any headnote or marginal note to the Article. But, ‘temporary’ and 
‘special’ are used in the marginal notes to specific articles of Part 21. And 370 specifically use 
uses the expression ‘temporary’.  
It had to, My Lords. It had to. 
Can we then by saying that the power under 
Clause 3 goes once the Constituent Assembly comes to an end, really convert this into a 
permanent provision, which it was never intend it to be by the Constitution? 
Your Lordships are not putting to me, it was never intended to. Within 370 
when it was put in, it had to be a temporary provision. It had to be, My Lord. There was nothing 
there at that point in time. It had to be, My Lords. It could never be a permanent thing.  
But, why did the Constitution then, put it in Part 
21?  
 
Because My Lords, it is separate. It relates to a particular state where the two 
sovereigns have come together, and made a compact which is incorporated and integrated… 
No, no, Part 21 does not deal only with Jammu & Kashmir, it deals 
with other states also.  
I’m sorry. I didn't get it. 
Part 21 does not deal only with Jammu & Kashmir.  
No, of course, not. That’s why I'm saying it's a separate independent provision, 
and has to be interpreted on its own terms. You can't incorporate  concepts outside of 370 and 
integrate them into 370 and say, this is how we'll read 370. 370 is not temporary. 370 is not 
temporary. 
The note expressly says it's temporary.  
No, it's says temporary provisions with respect to… Temporary provisions. In 
other words, this is a provision which is temporary, till such time as a Constituent Assembly 
decides this way or that way. That's the whole purpose, My Lords. Because when the 
Constitution came into force, there was no such thing as a Constituent Assembly even. How 
did the Constitution add this here? Because there was an understanding. Otherwise, why 
would you bring in the term ‘Constituent Assembly’ in 370? It was not anywhere else. 
Supposing… not that I should say so. I mean, one never knows. Suppose the Constituent 
Assembly decided not to be with India then what happens? You would have to do what we did 
to Junagadh. 
Because, there are two types of temporary 
provisions in Part 21. One type is Article 369. 369 says, Parliament had the power to make 
laws for a period of 5 years on certain matters, even if they may not be in the concurrent list. 
Absolutely.  
So, they were temporary with reference to time. 
They were temporal. Then 370 is an illustration of a case which is temporary, in the sense, it 
will operate till abrogated. Would it be? I mean…. 
 
Not till abrogated.  
When we are putting your point, we are actually 
thinking.  
I understand My Lords. Your Lordships have always done this, My Lords. This 
is a very fruitful debate, because we all have to understand. We are here standing for the people 
of India.  
And it's only in that process that we can.... 
This is not something that we believe we are totally integrated into India. 
That's not an issue My Lords. We have said so. Therefore there is no as far as... I mean the 
Constitution says, we are an integral part of India. So where's the question of moving away 
from that? There were only two choices, My Lords,, we said the Constituency Assembly of said 
all of constitutional to reply we'd be like to be any other state.  
Then they don't have to make a Constitution of their 
own.  
Then they don't have to make a Constitution of their own. 
Indian Constitution.... 
One second, they don't have to make a Constitution of their own. The 
Constituent Assembly would say we integrate into India. We're part of India. We're like any 
other state. We don't need a Constitution. And all those lists will apply. That power is there. 
So why was it called a temporary provision? Because that had to be decided by the Constituent 
Assembly. And then you interpret the terms to find out how that power is to be exercised, 
because it was unlike any other state. The residuary power was always with the state. In the 
Delhi Agreement in 1952, I have.... 
370, came in with the original Constitution.  
Yes.  
 
Is there anything in the Constituent Assembly 
debates which throws light on why they introduced it. 
I'll do that straight away. Yes. I will give Your Lordships that. Exactly what 
I'm saying is what they said.  
Let us see the...

Yes running page, but PDF 1174. 
Volume 8? 
Volume 8.  By now we know... we know Your Lordships illicit answers in 
order to find out what we wish to say. Not that Your Lordships have ever decided on one way 
or the other. You always do that. And I've seen....  
The last word is said in a manner Mr. Sibal, 
everything is open.  
When the printed word comes, that's the last word. 
As I've always said this, Mr Sibal if the judge is very 
quiet there is a problem.  
That's a real problem. It's a real problem  
 
And Mr Sibal there are times when you start 
dictating a judgment. You start dictating ... 
And then you change your mind.  
And you start dictating with a certain conclusion 
in mind because that's what you form. When you start dictating it, then you realize that your 
line of reasoning is wrong, because when you dictate the logical syntax has to fall in place and 
you are engaged with yourself. Then you realize no, no, no it's not going to fit in like this... 
Quite frankly, My Lords, and I'll be honest when I looked at it myself, I asked 
this question that Your Lordships is asking. I myself that question.  
4034? 
Yes 4035. 
Sorry. 1174.  
Yes 1174. Then kindly come to My Lords, the sentence starting... Sir, this 
matter Your Lordship has that? They set out My Lords... 
Gopalaswamy Iyengar ? 
Yes, Gopalaswamy Iyengar. Then it says, sir, this matter, the matter of this 
particular motion relates to Jammu and Kashmir. The House is fully aware of the fact that the 
State has acceded to the Dominion of India. The history of this accession is also well known. 
The accession took place on 26th October 1947. Since then, the state had a checkered history. 
Conditions are yet not normal. The meaning of this accession is that the present, that at 
present the state is a unit of a federal state, namely, the Dominion of India. This Dominion is 
getting transformed into a Republic which will be inaugurated on 26 January 1950. The 
Jammu and Kashmir State, therefore, has to become a unit of the new Republic of India. As 
the House is aware, accession to the Dominion always took place by means of an instrument 
which had to be signed by the ruler of the state and which had to be accepted by the Governor 
General of India. That has taken place in this case. As the House is also aware, instruments of 
accession are a thing of the past in the new Constitution, will be a thing of the past of the new 
Constitution. The States have been integrated with the Federal Republic in such manner that 
 
they do not have to accede or execute a document of accession for the purpose of becoming 
units of the Republic but they are mentioned in the Constitution itself. And in the case of 
practically all States other than the State of Jammu and Kashmir their constitutions also have 
been embodied in the Constitution for the whole of India, and all those other States have 
agreed to integrate themselves in that way and accept the Constitution provided. The 
discrimination is due to the special... why this discrimination? That's the question asked. The 
discrimination is due to the special conditions of Kashmir. That particular state is not yet ripe 
for this kind of integration. It is the hope of everybody here, that in due course even Jammu 
and Kashmir will become ripe for the same sort of integration as has taken place in the case of 
other States. At present it is not possible to achieve that integration. There are various reasons 
why this is not possible. Now, I shall refer again to this a little later. In the case of other Indian 
States or unions of States, there are two or three points which have got to be remembered. 
They have all accepted the Constitution framed for States in Part 1 of the new Constitution, 
and those provisions have been adapted so as to suit conditions of Indian States and Union of 
States. Secondly, the centre that is the Republican Federal Centre, will have power to make 
laws applying in every such state or union to all unions and concurrent subjects. Thirdly, a 
uniformity of relationship has been established between those States and unions and the 
centre. Kashmir's conditions are, as I have said special and requires special treatment. I do not 
want to take much time of the house, but I should briefly indicate the special conditions are. 
In the first place, there has been a war going on within the limits of Jammu and Kashmir. 
There was a ceasefire agreed to at the beginning of this year, and that ceasefire is still on. But 
the conditions in the State are still unusual and abnormal. They have not settled down. It is 
therefore necessary that the administration of the State should be geared to these unusual 
conditions until normal life is restored. Part of the State is still in the hands of rebels. We are 
entangled with the United Nations in regard to Jammu and Kashmir, and it is not possible to 
say, now, when we shall be free from this entanglement. That can take place only when 
Kashmir's problem is satisfactorily settled. Again the Government of India have committed 
themselves to the people of Kashmir in certain respects. They have committed themselves to 
the position that an opportunity would be given to the people of the state to decide for 
themselves whether they will remain with the Republic or wish to go out of it. We are also 
committed to ascertaining the will of the people by means of a plebiscite, 
provided that peaceful and normal conditions are restored and the impartiality of the 
plebiscite.... This is not relevant anymore. 
Next sentence.  
This is not relevant. The plebiscite issue is not relevant 
 
Which part is not relevant as per your comment? Even the 
part before that? 
Yes, now see further My Lords. We have also agreed that the will of people 
through the instrument of a Constituent Assembly will determine the Constitution of the State, 
as well as the sphere of union jurisdiction for the state. That's why it was a temporary 
provision. Now next paragraph, at present the Legislature, which was known as the Praja 
Sabha in the State, is dead. Neither that Legislature, nor a Constituent Assembly can be 
invoked or can function until complete peace comes to prevail in the State. We therefore, to 
deal with the government of the State, which has represented in its Council of Ministers, reflect 
the opinion of the largest political party in the State. Till a Constituent Assembly comes into 
being, only an interim arrangement is possible. Which is why it is temporary… and not an 
arrangement which could, at once, be brought into line with the arrangement that exists in the 
case of other states. This tells Your Lordships why it is temporary. Now, if you remember the 
viewpoint that I have mentioned, it is an inevitable conclusion, that at the present moment we 
could establish only an interim system… interim system, Article 306(a). Now, what is 306(a)? 
370… is an attempt to establish such a system, interim, till the Constituent Assembly decides. 
I shall now proceed… that’s not relevant. So clearly, My Lords, clearly, it gives you an 
indication why it was interim, it gives you an indication why it was temporary. Because there 
was nothing in place. Legislature was not working, Constituent Assembly was not in place, and 
the will of the people had to be taken, which was reflected in the Constituent Assembly. 
Therefore, it was temporary, and therefore 370 My Lords. Now, remember this, when 370 is 
enacted in 1950, at that point in time, nothing is in place. And yet in 373, they say, you will 
have to get the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly. That is dehors the Constituent 
Assembly having been formed. Dehors its Constitution. Why would, My Lords, the 
Constitution say that? Then kindly come to 4039, 2nd paragraph of 4039. Yes. Now, it's very 
interesting My Lords. Let's read the paragraph, then we come to Clause 2. First that, and then 
I'll read the other paragraph. Then we come to Clause 2. My Lords, have that? That’s PDF 1178. 
4039, that’s right. Now My Lords, actually....Maybe My Lords, I should start with Volume 8, 
1176. Let’s take 1176. PDF 1176. Running page 4037.  
Maybe you can read the whole thing.  
Yeah, I’ll read the whole thing. 
 
Because, it will be the interpretation they asked you 
before lunch.  
My Lords, most of Your Lordships’ questions hopefully are answered in this. 
There’s the second portion of this Article. 1076, My Lords. I shall now proceed to take the 
House through the provisions of this Article, that is, 306(a), which is 370. As honourable 
members will remember, the Constitution of Indian States is mainly governed by Article 211(a) 
of this Constitution, which applies to the Constitution to Indian States. The Constitution to 
Indian States… subject to the modifications contained in Part 6(a) of the Schedule. So far as 
that provision is concerned, I've already indicated to you that the provisions regarding the 
Constitution of other states could not, at present, be applied for Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, 
Clause 1 of A of this Article say that the provisions of 211(a) of this Constitution, shall not apply 
to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. That's 238, My Lords. 211(a) is 238. The second portion of 
this Article relates to the legislative authority of Parliament. So Parliament may, by law, 
...that's B over the State of Jammu and Kashmir. This is governed primarily by the Instrument 
of Accession. Broadly speaking, that legislative power is confined to the three subjects of 
defence, foreign affairs, and communications. But as a matter of fact, these broad categories 
include a number of items which are listed in the Instrument of Accession. I believe they 
include... I believe they are numbered some 20 to 25. Now these items have undergone a 
change in description, in numbering and arrangement, as among themselves in list 1 and list 
of the new Constitution. It is therefore necessary that the items mentioned in the Instrument 
of Accession should be brought in line with the changed designations of entries in the lists 1 
and 3 of the new Constitution. So Clause 1 (B) of 306(A) says that, 'this listing of items, as per 
the terms of the new Constitution, should be done by the President in consultation with the 
Government of the State'. That explains B(1). Clause B(2) refers to possible additions to the 
list in the Instrument of Accession, and these additions could be made according to the 
provisions of this Article with the concurrence of the Government of the State. The idea is that 
even before the Constituent Assembly meets, it may be necessary in the interests of both the 
centre and the state that certain items which are not included in the Instrument of Accession 
would be appropriately added to the list in that instrument so that administration, legislation, 
and executive action might be furthered. And as this may happen before the Constituent 
Assembly meets, the only authority from whom we can get consent for the addition is the 
Government of the State that is provided for. Then there is the explanation which defines what 
the Government of the State means. The Government of the State is defined both in the 
Constitution, which is now supposed to be in the force in Jammu and Kashmir, the State, as 
well as the proclamation with the Maharaja issued on 5th March 1948 the terms of which are 
as follows. 
 
Then kindly come to... now kindly come to C and D. Yes. Second last paragraph in 1177. PDF 
1177. 4038. My Lord has that? Clause C and D refer to the provisions of the Constitution other 
than matters listed in 1 and 3. These various provisions have been divided into certain 
categories. The first according to this draft, is that 'Article 1 of the Constitution will 
automatically apply'. As you know, it describes the territory of India and includes among those 
territories, all the States mentioned in part 3, and Jammu and Kashmir is one of the States 
mentioned in part 3. With regard to the other provisions in the Constitution, these will apply 
to the Jammu and Kashmir State with such exceptions and modifications, as may be decided 
on when the President issues an order to that effect. The order can be issued.... 
Just read the sentence once again. With regard to other 
provisions of the Constitution, these will apply when the President issues an order to that 
effect. That order can be issued with regard to subjects mentioned in the Instrument of 
Accession only after consultation with the Government of the State. With regard to other 
matters, concurrence of the Government has to be taken. 
That's B (1)and B (2). Two provisos. B(1), and B(2). That order can be issued 
in regard to subjects mentioned in  the instrument only after consultation in regard to the 
others in concurrence. Now it is not the case, nor is it the contention of the members of 
Kashmir Government, whom I took the opportunity of consulting before this draft was 
finalized. It's not their intentions as the other provisions of the Constitution are not to apply. 
That particular point of view is that with these provisions would apply only in cases where they 
can suitably apply and only subject to such modifications, with exceptions in the particular 
conditions of Jammu and Kashmir may require. I wish to say that no more about that 
particular point at the present moment. Then we come to Clause 2. You will remember that 
several of these clauses provide for concurrence of the government of Jammu and Kashmir 
State. Now these relate particularly to matters not mentioned in the Instrument of Accession 
and it is one of our commitments to the people and Government of Kashmir that no such 
additions should be made except with the consent of the Constituent Assembly, which may be 
called in the State for the purpose of framing its Constitution. In other words, what we are 
committed to is, that these additions are matters for determination by the Constituent 
Assembly of the state. This is commitment. Now, you will recall that in some of the clauses of 
this Article we have provided for concurrence of the government of the State. The government 
of the State feel that in view of the commitments already entered between the State and the 
centre, they cannot be regarded as final authorities for the giving of this concurrence, though 
they are prepared to give it in the interim period. But if they do not give this concurrence this 
 
clause, if they do give this concurrence, the clause provides that, that concurrence should be 
placed before the Constituent Assembly, when it meets on the Constituent Assembly will take 
whatever decision it likes to take. My Lords, what can be clearer than this? The last clause 
refers to what may happen later on which is why it is temporary. 
The paragraph which you read, is with reference to Clause 2, 
not with reference to Clause 3...  
Yes, I'm not saying that I am just reading  
The last Clause is Clause 3? 
I am not saying that. I am saying, I am reading it holistically. So you know 
why it is called temporary.  
2 and 3 are temporary.  
2 and 3 are temporary, no doubt about it because they have to be actually 
agreed upon by the legislature by the Constituent Assembly. Now see 3. The last clause refers 
to what may happen later on. We have said Article 211(a), which is 238(a) will not apply to 
Jammu and Kashmir. That cannot be a permanent feature of the Constitution of the State and 
hope it will not be. So, the provision is made that when the Constituent Assembly of the State 
has met and taken its decision both on the Constitution for that state and on the range of 
federal jurisdiction over the state. The President may, on the recommendation of the 
Constituent Assembly, issue an order that this Article 306(a) shall either cease to be operative 
or shall be operative only subject to such exceptions and modifications, as is specified by him. 
But before he issues any order of that kind, the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly 
will be a condition precedent, that explains the whole of the Article. There can be nothing 
clearer than this. I mean, we in hindsight sitting in 2023 can't interpret a provision except on 
its terms. We are here to interpret the Constitution. We are not here to legitimize a process 
which is inconsistent with the express terms of the Constitution. Next paragraph. The effect of 
this article is, that the Jammu and Kashmir State, which is now a part of India, will continue 
to be a part of India, will be a unit of the future Federal Republic of India, and the Union 
Legislature will get jurisdiction to enact laws on matters specified either in the instrument of 
accession or by later addition, with the concurrence of the Government of the state and steps 
have to be taken for the purpose of convening a Constituent Assembly in due course, which 
will go into the matters I have already referred to. When it comes to a decision on the different 
 
matters, it will make a recommendation to the President, who will either abrogate 306(a) or 
direct that it should apply with such modification and the exception of the Constituent 
Assembly may recommend. That Sir, is briefly a description of the effect of this Article and I 
hope the house will carry it. This explains several things. One, why it was a temporary 
provision. Two, Constituent Assembly had not been constituted then. It was envisaged in our 
Constitution, that it will be constituted. And the ultimate authority of abrogating 370 will be 
left to the Constituent Assembly.  
And a precondition of that would be a recommendation of… the recommendation of the 
Constituent Assembly for the President to pass an order. Absent that, it can't be done. That 
was the understanding of the lawmakers, of the Constitution makers of India, of the 
Constituent Assembly. That is why it was put in. It was not a temporary provision, in the sense, 
that it had ultimately… 370 had to be abrogated. That's not the meaning of the temporary 
provision that we're talking about. In any case, My Lords, a heading of an article can’t 
determine the content of the article. Content of the article is clear. So, My Lords, the 
government of the day was staring at the provisions of Article 370, and according to me, 
through a political act, not a constitutional procedure, declared that 370 is gone. That's why I 
said, it was tossed out of the window through a political act, not through a Constitutional act. 
Such a political act cannot be determined by the Parliament of India. It's not in the remit of 
the Parliament of India to take a political decision to abrogate 370. Now I’ll demonstrate as we 
move along My Lords, how it was done and in what matter it was done. Nobody can deny, that 
the people of Jammu & Kashmir are with the Union; it is an integral part. Nobody can deny 
that. But there is a special relationship, there is a unique relationship which is engrafted in 
itself. You can't jettison that, except by following a process which is ordained by law. So 
My Lordships asked me on the constituent… I wanted to just mention this. These are the… My 
Lords…                        
{NO AUDIO} 
My Lords I just want to mention that all the amendments sought, My Lords 
were all rejected and withdrawn. 
Not moved to? 
Not moved.  
[UNCLEAR], he did not move those amendments? 
 
Yes. So My Lords, may I go back to the list of dates now that I have put my 
provision on Article 370, straightaway? Let’s go back to the list of dates. My Lords kindly come 
to my written submissions, Volume 2 and the PDF page is 41. 
Same page? 
Same page that I left.  
We are on the list of dates that serial where you left? 
Yes you are right. Unless we have a clear picture of 370 My Lord, it will be 
difficult to.... item 33 at page PDF 41. My Lords have that?  Justice Surya Kant? 
Yes. 
Under 370, sub-article 1 of the Constitution and following consultation of the 
Government of Jammu and Kashmir, the President issued the Constitution Application of 
Jammu & Kashmir's Amendment Order 39, modifying Articles 54, 55 of the Constitution as 
long as they applied to State of Jammu and Kashmir. Now My Lords, Your Lordships will 
notice each of these orders were issued under D(1), D(1) all of these orders. 
B(1)?  
D(1), all of these orders. Then in 1952, on the 10th of June, My Lords on June 
10th, '52, the basic principles of Committee of Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly 
submitted its interim report to the Jammu and Kashmir's Constituent Assembly and 
recommended that the form of the future Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir shall be wholly 
democratic. The institution of hereditary rulership shall be terminated. The office of the Head 
of State shall be elective. Then the next is very important. In 1952, the Delhi Government, 
Delhi Agreement of 1952 was entered into between the Government of India and the 
Government of Jammu and Kashmir. Under this agreement, the Government of India agreed 
that while residuary powers of the Legislature vested in Parliament in respect of other States, 
in the case of Jammu and Kashmir, such powers vested in the State itself. This is what My 
Lords asked me the question. Now, My Lords, kindly read this document. It's very important. 
Volume 1 of the Compilation of Documents. Pages 13, PDF 13. Your Lordship has that, the 
Delhi Agreement 1952? Justice Surya Kant has that? This is My Lords, page 13, PDF 13.   
 
This doesn't seem to be the main agreement. 
This seems to be some summary of the features of the agreement.  
Yes, yes.  
Yes it's a summary of what are perceived. 
What the features are. 
Where is the summary taken from because the 
authenticity will depend on that? 
The very next page it's there, My Lord, I believe. It is Sheikh Muhammad 
Abdullah's statement to the Constituent Assembly on the Delhi Agreement on 11th August 
1952, that's at PDF 16.   
That's the actual extract? 
Yes. I can read that My Lords. I can read that. That's not the original either. 
I will get you the original. They will have it in any case. What is at page 13 is an is an extract of 
the original. Summary. 
It’s the summary, actually.  
Page 16 is the extract.  
Page 15 is actually Sheikh Mohammad 
Abdullah’s statement to the Constituent Assembly.  
Statement My Lords. Can I read the summary, My Lords? This is not 
something that will be…  
You want to read the summary? 
It says that, in view of the uniform and consistent stand taken by the Jammu 
& Kashmir Constituent Assembly, the sovereignty, in all matters, other than those specified in 
 
the Instrument of Accession, continues to reside in the state. The Government of India agreed 
that while the residuary power of the legislature vested at the centre in respect of all states 
other than Jammu and Kashmir, in the case of the latter, they vested in the state itself.  It was 
agreed between the two governments, that in accordance with Article 5 of the Indian 
Constitution, persons who have their domicile… we’re not concerned so much with the 
domicile issue. And, I can read it… that the two governments in accordance with Article 5, 
persons who have their domicile in Jammu & Kashmir shall be regarded as citizens of India… 
This is a state subject, Mr. Sibal. It may not be directly 
relevant.  
That's why I said My Lords. Then 4 is, the Union Government agreed that 
the state should have its own flag in addition to the Union flag, but it is agreed by the State 
Government, that the state flag would not be a rival to the Union. It is also recognized… keep 
that out.  
How Sadr-e-Riyasat has to be… 
Yeah, so that also. Then (vi).  With regard to the fundamental rights, some 
basic principles agreed between the parties were enunciated. It was accepted, that the people 
of the states were to have their fundamental rights. But in view of the peculiar position in 
which the state was placed, the whole chapter relating to fundamental rights of the Indian 
Constitution could not be made applicable to the state. The question which remained to be 
determined was, whether the chapter on fundamental rights should form a part of the state 
Constitution of the Constitution of India, as applicable to the state. So, it was not My Lords, 
applied at that time, fully. With regard to the jurisdiction… I’ll leave that out, that’s on the 
Supreme Court. And then My Lords, there was a great deal of discussion, Item 8. With regard 
to the emergency power, the Government of India insisted on the application of Article 352, 
empowering the President to proclaim a general emergency in the state. State Government 
argued that in the exercise of its powers of a defence, Item 1 of the union list, in the event of 
war and external aggression, the government would have full authority to take steps and 
proclaim emergency. But the state delegation was, however, averse to President exercising the 
power to proclaim a general emergency on account of internal disturbance, which ultimately 
Your Lordship knows, was also taken out of the Indian Constitution under 352.  
At the relevant time it was there.  
 
It was there at the relevant time, but the state said we will not allow it to be 
exercised.  
Just trying to think aloud, at the relevant time in ’75… 
Yes, it was there.  
It was there. Then, this, through some subsequent 
orders, equally applied to Jammu & Kashmir at that time.  
That’s correct. Absolutely right.  
This summary which my friend [UNCLEAR] Agreement Summary, 
this seems to have been taken out of this book by Justice A.S. Anand. 
It’s not publicly available, but Justice Anand has that.  
No, it’s published. Constitution of Jammu & Kashmir.  
The agreement is not publicly available. 
No, he has given the authoritative statement, in the sense, what does 
it imply? 
This is also part of the compilation My Lord.  
Yes, yes.  
Then My Lords, in order to meet the viewpoint of the state delegation, 
Government of India agreed to the modification of 352 in its application to Kashmir, while the 
addition of the following work, but in regard to internal [UNCLEAR] of the request, or with 
the concurrence of the government of the state. That's how My Lords. But, the parties agreed 
that the application of 356 dealing with suspension of the State Constitution, and 360, dealing 
with financial emergency, was not necessary.  
Then My Lords, Sheikh Abdullah's  statement to the Constituent Assembly on 11th August. "I 
create permission to make a statement before the House in regard to the constitutional 
 
relationship with Jammu & Kashmir and the Indian Union. The honourable members are 
aware during the last session of the Constituent Assembly, the Basic Principles Committee had 
submitted a report making certain specific recommendations about the future Head of the 
State. House while accepting these recommendations had chart the Drafting Committee to 
present for the consideration of the Assembly, a draft resolution, incorporating the proposed 
principles for the election of the Head of State. Drafting Committee will no doubt submit its 
report to the House, since the changes proposed in the assembly involved corresponding 
adjustments in the Indian Constitution, Government of India desired that it should have time 
to discuss with our representative other matters pertaining to the constitutional relationship 
of our state with the Union. During the last stage of these discussions, it became necessary for 
me and some of my other colleagues in the government to participate in the talks. I'm now in 
a position to inform the House that certain broad principles have been laid down and certain 
decisions have been tentatively arrived at between the two Governments. The basis of our 
relationship with India is the Instrument of Accession, which enabled our state to enter into a 
Union with India in accordance with the terms of instrument. Of the Instrument certain 
powers were transferred to the centre. The principle matter specified as a purpose in respect 
to Dominion Legislature made Laws for the state, were they arranged this arrangement 
involved a division of sovereignty, which is the normal feature of a Federation beyond the 
powers transferred to it by to the Union. The State enjoyed complete residuary sovereignty."  
That's why My Lords, when you read 370, you can't read into it, the other matters. But these 
terms of the association of our state with the Dominion were maintained, and subsequently, 
when the Constituent Assembly of India was charged with a task for framing of Constitution 
this overriding consideration was kept in view in determining the position of the State in the 
proposed Constitution. Earlier to this, it had been agreed between the two governments that 
in view of the special problems arising in respect of the State and the fact that the Government 
of India have assured its people they would themselves finally determine the political future, 
a special position should be accorded to Jammu and Kashmir in the future Constitution so, 
that a limited field of the Union powers over the State is ensured. Our representatives were 
nominated by the Jammu and Kashmir State of the Constituent Assembly of India. These 
representatives participated in the deliberation of the Assembly in India at a time, when the 
bulk of the Indian Constitution has already been adopted. It was at this stage, that the 
constitutional position of the State was determined in the Constitution of India. This is very 
important. It was a collaborative exercise... a dialogue. It was not My Lords behind the back of 
the Union of India or anything like that. They knew what was to happen in the future. 
Representatives of Jammu and Kashmir reiterated their views that Association with India 
should be based on the term of the Instrument of Accession. It was at this stage that the 
constitutional position was determined. The representatives of the Jammu and Kashmir State 
 
reiterated their views that an Association with India should be based on the terms of the 
Instrument of Accession. It was also made clear that while the accession of Jammu and 
Kashmir State with India was complete, in fact and law to the extent of the subjects 
enumerated in this instrument, the autonomy of the State with regard to all other subjects 
outside the ambit of the Instrument of Accession should be preserved. And hence, a good deal 
of confused thinking and uninformed criticism is indulged in some interested people, I would 
like to point out that the Constitution has confined the scope and jurisdiction of the Union 
powers to the terms of the Instrument of Accession with the proviso. They may be extended to 
such of the matters as the President may, by order specify with the incurrence of the Jammu 
and Kashmir Assembly. This is qua, My Lords, the concurrent list matters. The special 
problems facing the State was thus taken into account and under the Constitution, the 
relationship approximated to that subsisting under the instrument of Accession. The 
Constitution of India, of the Indian Union, therefore clearly envisioned the convening of a 
Constituent Assembly for the Jammu and Kashmir State, which would be finally competent to 
determine the ultimate position of the State in respect to the sphere of its succession, which 
would be incorporated as in the shape of permanent provisions of the Constitution. That's why 
temporary. The rest really need not trouble, Your Lordships. So I need not trouble Your 
Lordships.  
Then, My Lords, residuary powers, its important. Page 19. PDF 19. There is a heading of 
Residuary Powers. It was agreed that while under the present Indian Constitution, the 
Residuary Powers vested in the centre in respect of all the States, other than Jammu and 
Kashmir. In the case of our State, they vested in the state itself. This position is compatible, 
compatible with Article 370 of the Constitution of India and the Instrument of Accession on 
which this article is based. We have always held that the ultimate source of sovereignty resides 
in the people. It is therefore, from the people that all powers can flow under these 
circumstances. It is up to the people of Kashmir through this assembly to transfer more powers 
of mutual advantage to the custody of the Union. So, but what happens ultimately, since I will 
come to that later, is that Parliament exercised the will of the people of Jammu and Kashmir 
when they abrogated the Article. That's what happened. They took upon themselves the 
constitutional responsibility of saying that we are now the legislature, we are the Constituent 
Assembly and we will exercise the will of the people of State of Jammu and Kashmir, to say 
that we abrogate 370. In essence, that's what happened. Is that possible constitutionally? Is 
that envisaged by 370? Is this not an exercise of political power, without reference to 370? And 
can such a power be exercised in the manner in which it was exercised? That's a matter of 
procedure. Then there is citizenship. We need not go into it. Fundamental rights. We don't 
 
have to go into all this. Now, kindly come to list of dates again. Right back at 42, item 37 Article 
370. Sub- Article 3, PDF My Lords 42. My Lord Justice Gavai has it? 
Yes, 37? 
Yes. Under.... just wondering whether all of Your Lordships have it? I have 
to say, My Lords, that I've been a... and even though I say it to myself, a good student, because 
I can access it immediately. 
This is my second Constitution Bench, wherein the 
Chief Justice made me take to this.  
My Lord said to me, I am not going to allow you to argue... so I had to learn.  
Yes. 
37, My Lords. Under Article 370, sub-article 3 of the Constitution, the 
President, after a recommendation for J&K Assembly, issued Notification 44 modifying 370 
to include an explanation with the phrase State Government meant the Sadr-e-Riyasat, acting 
in Indian advice of the Council. Kindly note that, that was done by the Constituent Assembly. 
That's the only time My Lords, they exercised their powers with reference to 370. On 14th of 
May 1954, with the concurrence of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir, the President 
issued the Constitution Adaptation to Jammu and Kashmir Order of 1954, which came into 
force on May 14, 1954. This order superseded the Constitution Application to Jammu and 
Kashmir order of 1950, which had only those limited provisions. Paragraph 2 of the said Order 
set those provisions of the Constitution, which, in addition to Articles 1 and 370, because that 
order only had Article 1 and 370 would be applicable and other than 1, sorry, other than 1 
would be applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Notably, a second proviso was 
introduced into Article 3 as applied to the State of Jammu and Kashmir in the following terms, 
provided that no bill providing for increasing or diminishing the area, this is also very 
important, of the State of Jammu & Kashmir altering the name of boundary of that State shall 
be introduced in Parliament without the consent of the legislature of that state.  
Your Lordship knows, My Lords, Article 3, they can change the boundaries. What happened 
in this case was, not that they changed the boundaries My Lords, they converted it into a union 
territory, which is the other problematic issue, which of course, we'll have to argue later. You 
can change the boundaries of a state, you can bifurcate the boundaries of a large state into 
 
smaller states, but never in the history of this country has a state been converted into a union 
territory. 
You can carve out a union territory out of a state. 
You can carve out, but you can’t have all of Madhya Pradesh be a union 
territory tomorrow.  
As per my understanding [UNCLEAR] some 
assurance that on assembly elections being held, Jammu & Kashmir will be a state.  
No, that’s true. But, My Lords, what they have converted it into a union 
territory as of now. I mean, that’s unthinkable. And, under the Article for Jammu & Kashmir, 
there was a special provision that that has to be consented to. That was also not done. So My 
Lords, you move away from representative democracy, convert it into a union territory under 
your direct rule, you do away with representative democracy, and five years have passed. Every 
day we hear that we are going to soon have elections. But, there has to be a constitutional basis 
for doing this My Lords. And, kindly note one thing. In May 2019, there were parliamentary 
elections in the state of Jammu & Kashmir. In 2019. May, three months after this. This 
happened on the 6th of August. September, October, November, December… May you have 
parliamentary elections. So, you can hold parliamentary elections, but you will not hold state 
elections. But, that's moving away to another issue, altogether.  
So My Lords, then 39, 17-11-1956, the Constituent Assembly of Jammu & Kashmir, in exercise 
of its constituent powers, approved and adopted the Constitution of Jammu & Kashmir. Which 
is why I started off with a proposition, that the concept of a Constituent Assembly is a political 
exercise. That political authority, that political body, can decide on the future of the state; 
could have decided on the future of the state. But, that's a political decision. You want to 
abrogate 370, abrogate 370. You want to go integrate it into India completely, say we don't 
need a Constitution. But, that's a political act. That political act cannot be, cannot be exercised 
by Parliament, by a legislative body, because that legislative body is controlled by the 
Constitution, and its functions are controlled by the Constitution. It can't go beyond that. 
Which is why I made that statement at the beginning. Then My Lords, 40. The Constitution of 
Jammu & Kashmir, 1957, came into force on January 26th, 1957. By means of this 
Constitution, the people of the state of Jammu & Kashmir, having solemnly resolved in the 
presence of the accession of the state of India, which took place on 26th day of October, 1947, 
to further define the existing relationship of the state of the Union of India as an integral part 
 
thereof. That's declared in the Constitution. So, nobody can question that. Nobody need 
question that. Nobody can say that we are not being regarded. We were not saying that we are 
not an integral part of India. Article 1 applies, and the Constitution defined that relationship. 
And, having defined that relationship, you can't just difficile it.  
Section 5 of the Constitution of Jammu & Kashmir provided, that the legislative part of the 
state extended to all matters, except those with respect to which Parliament had power to make 
laws for the state under the Constitution of India as applicable. Sorry. As applicable to the 
State of Jammu and Kashmir. Legislative powers in the State were to lie with the Legislative 
Assembly and the Legislative Council. Significantly, Section 147, which dealt with 
amendments to the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir provided that no bill or amendment 
seeing to change the provisions of the Constitution of India, as they applied to Jammu and 
Kashmir, would be introduced or moved in either of the state legislature. They had no 
authority once the Constitution has come into force and the orders passed. Then on 21-11-
1964, the Constitution Application to Jammu & Kashmir's Third Amendment Order of 1964, 
that is CO 71, which amended the 54 order, made Article 356 applicable to the State with one 
modification that, 'the expression included the Constitution'... Sorry... Excluded the 
Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir... Included... Yes... Included the Constitution of Jammu 
and Kashmir. 
Orders are there in all which had been passed? 
My Lords...Just, I have a list.  
You can just give the list ... 
Volume Three, you have all the orders.  
This... You have now made your point on this... All the 
orders...  
I'm not asking Your Lordships to go through... I'm not even going to read it, 
My Lords. We are not going to go into all this. 
53-54. About 54 orders are there. 
54 orders are there. Around 54 orders.  
 
[UNCLEAR] 
Yes, yes. Of course, of the Assembly.  
Government. 
The Government, My Lords. 
Section, under D or under...? 
D... D(1). 
D? 
D(1) 
Not... B(2) or D... B(2) or D(1)? D? 
D(2), My Lords. 
D(2)? 
D(1)...D(1). 
D. Only has one... proviso... proviso. 
It's just D. 
It doesn't have a number 2 or... 
And most of them are amendments of the 54 Order My Lords. 50 order, 54 
order, and then amendments to the 54 order. That's what it is.  
[NO AUDIO]   
Item 43... 
 
Yes. 
If Your Lordships don't mind, it is PDF 44. 'The Kashmir Accord.' Now, that's 
a political document. 1975 was entered into... My Lords, have it? PDF 44. 'The Kashmir Accord' 
'75 was entered into between the Government of India and the Government of Jammu and 
Kashmir. Under 'Clause 1' of the accord, the relationship of the State of Jammu and Kashmir 
with the Union was to continue to be governed by Article 370 of the Constitution. Now kindly 
note My Lords, the temporary provision was over. Still be governed. 
Why was this required to say it is to be governed if it 
is a permanent feature? 
Sorry? 
Why was there a requirement in [UNCLEAR] to say 
this will continue to govern when it was a permanent....? 
My Lords, it also reiterates the Residuary Powers of the State. That's not the 
only thing that happened. It's just a reiteration of the position that was accepted by the 
Government of India throughout, which is the constitutional provision. After all, it's a political 
accord My Lords. It has no legal basis that way. But it tells you of the intent of the signatories, 
My Lords.  
Political change at that time.  
Yes, I know that. I know that. In any case, '75 is a momentous time in the 
history of this country. Luckily I was out of the country My Lords, so I...  
Response to the Sheikh Abdullah settlement... 
Yes, yes. In fact, My Lords, the background is and Sheikh Abdullah has been 
in and out. It was in and out of jail for ultimately 14 years. The background is My Lord that 
whenever he came out, he was saying that no, give us autonomy, give us autonomy. It is in that 
context that the Accord was there that you can't get out of 370. That's really the background 
to it. He was put in jail even by Mrs. Gandhi. So My Lords the rest of the list of dates, kindly 
 
now, come straight to PDF 47. On 29 March 2017.... Then, of course, the clamouring began 
remove 370, do away with 370. That's a separate issue and you are not concerned with that... 
You are on 55 now?  
55 exactly, My Lord. Justice Khanna has 55? Justice Gavai? Justice Surya 
Kant? Member of Parliament Ratna De Nag  raised the question whether the Minister of Law 
and Justice as to whether the government proposes to amend and remove 370 related to 
Jammu and Kashmir in the near future, if so details thereof, not the reason, therefore, whether 
this will help in providing equitable justice to the people of the State and if so the details 
thereof, Minister of State of Law and Justice at such so and so. At present there is no such 
proposal under consideration.  
These are only proposals? 
These are only proposal laws. No, no, no, throughout. The list goes on My 
Lords. Then 57 is My Lords. Section 92. This is important. Item 57 of Section 92 of the 
Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir deals with provisions in case of a failure of the 
constitutional machinery in the State. Provision permitted the Governor to, by proclamation, 
assume to himself all the powers and functions of the government of the State. Such a 
proclamation would, in terms of 92(5) require the concurrence of the President of India. Under 
92(3), would cease to operate six months after it was issued. On June 20, 2018. The Governor, 
with the concurrence or the President, issued a proclamation under 92, declaring Governor's 
Rule in the State. This is important. Now we’re coming to the present controversy. We can do 
it tomorrow, My Lords.  
We can continue tomorrow.  
Deeply obliged My Lords.
